"Polystichum aculeatum, the hard shield-fern, is an evergreen fern native to Europe. It is most abundant in upland regions of the British Isles and western France, where it benefits from the combination of mild winters and moist summers, but also occurs more locally across most of Europe except northern Scandinavia, northern Russia; in the Mediterranean region it is confined to high altitudes. It grows on steep slopes in woodlands. The glossy dark green fronds are 30–90 cm long, usually drooping downslope, with typically 3-8 fronds on a mature plant. The fronds are stiff and hard-textured, bipinnate (single-pinnate on small, young plants), with the pinnae opposite on the stalk. Each pinna is 3–11 cm long, with a large upward-pointing pinnule at the base, and the other pinnules decreasing in size toward the pinna tip; the pinnules have bristly tips. Individual fronds live for 1.5-2.5 years and remain attached to the rhizome after withering. The round sori occupy two rows on either side of the midrib of each pinnule and are covered by a centrally-attached, umbrella-like indusium with fringed edges. They produce light yellow spores. It is occasionally grown as an ornamental plant in gardens.",nature,7

"The desert wheatear (Oenanthe deserti) is a wheatear, a small passerine bird that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher (Muscicapidae). It is a migratory insectivorous species, 14.5 to 15 cm (5.7 to 5.9 in) in length. Both western and eastern forms of the desert wheatear are rare vagrants to western Europe. The western desert wheatear breeds in the Sahara and the northern Arabian peninsula. The eastern race is found in the semi-deserts of central Asia and in winter in Pakistan and northeast Africa. The plumage of the upper parts of the male in summer is buff. The underparts are white with a buff tinge on the breast. The black on the face and throat extends to the shoulders, and there is distinct white superciliary stripe. The female is greyer above and buffer below and has no black on the throat, and in the winter plumage the black on the throat of the male is partially obscured by the white tips of the feathers. A distinguishing characteristic, in both sexes of all ages, is that the entire tail is black to the level of the upper tail-coverts. The desert wheatear feeds largely on insects which it picks up off the ground. It breeds in the spring when a clutch of usually four pale blue, slightly speckled eggs is laid in a well-concealed nest made of grasses, mosses and stems.",nature,7

"The little woodswallow (Artamus minor), is a bird patchily distributed over much of mainland Australia, avoiding only the driest deserts and the area within about 300 kilometres of the southern coastline, and showing a preference for rugged terrain around inland ranges. As its name suggests, at 12 to 14 cm in length it is the smallest of the woodswallows. It is dark, smoky brown overall, with deep gunmetal grey wings and a black-tipped, blue-tinged bill. Like other woodswallows, groups cluster huddled close together on high, dead branches to rest or sleep. Typical group sizes are modest but it is not uncommon to have hundreds gather together at a roost site. Little woodswallows soar effortlessly above the treetops or along cliff faces when hunting flying insects—being small, they are easily confused with martins. The nest is a rudimentary affair, placed in a tree hollow or similar space, and made of twigs and other vegetable matter. Breeding takes place from August to January, or after rain. Three eggs are laid and the young leave the nest when barely able to fly, taking up a perch on a nearby tree and calling incessantly for the food the parents bring them.",nature,7

"The Tasmanian emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae diemenensis) is an extinct subspecies of the emu. It was found on Tasmania where it had become isolated during the Late Pleistocene. As opposed to the other insular emu taxa, the King Island and the Kangaroo Island emu, the population on Tasmania was sizable, meaning that there were no marked effects of small population size as in the other two isolates. Thus, the Tasmanian Emu had not progressed to the point where it could be considered a distinct species, and even its status as a distinct subspecies is not universally accepted as it agreed with the mainland birds in measurements and the external characters used to distinguish it—a whitish instead of black foreneck and throat and an unfeathered neck—apparently are also present, albeit rare, in some mainland birds. There are suggestions the bird was slightly smaller than the modern emu, but in conflict, other evidence (including descriptions of Pleistocene remains) indicates that both are similar in size. Today, it is apparently only known from subfossil bones, the skins which once existed having been lost.",nature,7

"Jenny Lake is located in Grand Teton National Park in the U.S. state of Wyoming. The lake was formed approximately 12,000 years ago by glaciers pushing rock debris which carved Cascade Canyon during the last glacial maximum, forming a terminal moraine which now impounds the lake. The lake is estimated to be 423 feet (129 m) deep and encompasses 1,191 acres (482 ha). Jenny Lake is considered to be a major focal point in Grand Teton National Park, with many hiking trails, scenic boat rides, and quick access to the major climbing routes onto the tallest peaks of the Teton Range. Jenny and Jackson Lakes are the only lakes in Grand Teton National Park where motorboats are permitted; both lakes have scenic tours available. A 2005 study of the water quality of the lakes in Grand Teton National Park indicated that all the lakes in the park were still considered pristine and that they had not been impacted by air or water pollution. Jenny Lake is a starting point for many day and overnight hiking trips. The 7.1-mile (11.4 km) Jenny Lake Trail loops around the lake and is considered to be relatively easy due to the small altitude gain of 700 feet (210 m). However, the altitude increases rapidly once Cascade Canyon is entered. Jenny Lake is named after a Shoshone Indian woman who married an Englishman, Richard \""Beaver Dick\"" Leigh. Jenny, and their 6 children, died of Smallpox in 1876.",nature,7

"The Indian mud moray, Gymnothorax tile, is a moray eel found in the western Pacific and Indian Oceans. It was first named by Hamilton in 1822, and is also commonly known as the freshwater moray or freshwater snowflake eel. It lives in marine conditions, but travels to fresh water for breeding and spawning. When kept as pets, Indian mud morays actually thrive better in brackish water, rather than pure fresh water. It is said to reach a length of about 24 in (0.61 m). These eels can live up to 30 years. The species is characterized by a black body with orange and white speckles covering the length of the body. Gymnothorax tile, like any other moray eel, possesses a second set of jaws, called the pharyngeal jaws, to swallow their prey. This eel also possesses terrible eyesight, and instead relies upon a keen sense of smell and vibrations in the water to detect prey or approaching threats. It is for the most part a scavenger that eats dead fish, krill, shrimp, and other such foods. Due to its poor eyesight, this eel does not hunt on a normal basis, but will resort to hunting if there is no other option.",nature,7

"Portia schultzi is a jumping spider which ranges from South Africa in the south to Kenya in the north, and also is found in West Africa and Madagascar. In this species, which is slightly smaller than some other species of the genus Portia, the bodies of females are 5 to 7 mm long, while those of males are 4 to 6 mm long. The carapaces of both sexes are orange-brown with dark brown mottling, and covered with dark brown and whitish hairs lying over the surface. Males have white tufts on their thoraces and a broad white band above the bases of the legs,and these features are less conspicuous in females. Both sexes have tufts of orange to dark orange above the eyes, which are fringed with pale orange hairs. Males' abdomens are yellow-orange to orange-brown with blackish mottling, and on the upper sides are black and light orange hairs, and nine white tufts. Those of females are pale yellow and have black markings with scattered white and orange-brown hairs on the upper side. P. schultzi has relativity longer legs than other Portia, and a \""lolloping\"" gait. While most jumping spiders focus accurately up to about 75 cm away, P. schultzi responds to a maximum of about 10 cm in good light, and ignores everything in very subdued light. For prey, P. schultzi prefers web-based spiders, then jumping spiders, and finally insects. The females of P. schultzi and other Portia species build \""capture webs\"" to catch prey, and often join their own webs on to web-based spiders to catch the other spiders or their prey. If a P. schultzi female is mature, a male P. schultzi will try to copulate with her, or cohabit with a subadult female and copulate while she is moulting. They usually mate on a web or on a dragline made by the female, and P. schultzi typically copulates for about 100 seconds, while others in the genus can take several minutes or even several hours. Females try to kill and eat their mates during or after copulation, and subadult females mimic adult females to attract males as prey. Contests between Portia females are violent, and embraces in P. schultzi typically take 20 to 60 seconds. Sometimes, one female knocks the other on her back and the other may be killed and eaten if she does not right herself quickly and run way. When hunting, P. schultzi mature females emit olfactory signals that reduce the risk that any other females, males, or juveniles of the same species may contend for the same prey.",nature,7

"Arabibarbus grypus is a species of Cyprinid fish called in English and Persian or Arabic by the common names shirbot and variations shabut, shabboot or shabbout, and in local languages by several other common names. It is a large freshwater carp found in the Tigris-Euphrates Basin. It is a commercially fished species in this region. This species can grow to a length of nearly 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) and a weight of over 50 kg (110 lb). A. grypus has recently been in the news  when it was proposed that this \""shabut\"" was identical to the fish called in the Talmud shibuta (שיבוטא). The latter's brain is famous for being touted as the kosher equivalent, taste-wise, of the otherwise forbidden and even taboo pork meat (cf. Chullin 109b). However, names of species are notorious for changing over time and between related languages, a fact, incidentally, the Talmud itself attests. The fact that Arabibarbus grypus is called in Modern Hebrew Shibuta is no proof that it is the same fish as the Talmudic one, as Modern Hebrew has a strong tendency to assimilate local Arabic names for such realia. The fish is also being considered for aquaculture. Many species of carp are farmed as a protein source already.",nature,7

"Cyathea cranhamii is an extinct species of tree fern. It was described based on permineralised sori from the Early Cretaceous deposits of Apple Bay in Vancouver Island, British Columbia. C. cranhamii has sori arranged in two rows on narrow pinnules. They are covered by globose indusia which resemble those of Sphaeropteris species in morphology. Sporangia are circinate (ring-shaped) and bear multicellular stalks. They diverge from a basal, vascular receptacle. The sporangia contain 64 trilete spores which bear sculpturing on their outer covering (perispore) ranging from irregular granulate or echinate to prominent rodlets. The annulus is nearly vertical and arranged in a single series. It is not interrupted by the stalk. The specimens used to describe C. cranhamii are the first anatomically preserved tree fern sori known from the fossil record.

Parsley frogs are typical-looking frogs closely related to European spadefoot toads and megophryids, but differ largely in appearance. Unlike the megophryids, they do not have cryptic colouring, usually being green or brown. Unlike the European spadefoot toads, they lack hardened protrusions on their feet, although they are still fossorial, and are generally slender. The parsley frogs are small, smooth-skinned frogs, reaching a length of 5 cm (2.0 in).

"Abactochromis is a monotypic genus of cichlid fish containing the single species Abactochromis labrosus (formerly known as Melanochromis labrosus). The genus name combines the Latin for \""driven away from\"" (\""ab\"" - away from, \""actus\"" - driven) with the commonly used haplochromine name \""chromis\"". The name encompasses both the origin of the genus (the species was \""banished\"" from the genus Melanochromis) and the fish's solitary, wandering behaviour (as if it had been driven away from the other cichlids). A. labrosus is found in Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania. Its natural habitat is freshwater Lake Malawi.

"Zodarion germanicum is a spider species of the Zodariidae family. Like most Zodariidae, Z. germanicum is an ant-eating spider. It resembles ants structurally and behaviorally. Z. germanicum specifically mimics large dark ants, such as Formica cinerea, F. truncorum, and Camponotus ligniperda. Z. germanicum is up to 5 mm in size. Adults occur in Germany from June to August. Unlike many other zodariid spiders, it is active during the day. If the spider encounters an ant, it retreats and stalks its prey from behind. The bitten ant will continue its walk for about a minute before the poison immobilizes it. Only now the spider will approach its prey and carries it to its hideout.",nature,7

"The Norfolk parakeet (Cyanoramphus cookii), also called Tasman parakeet, Norfolk Island green parrot or Norfolk Island red-crowned parakeet, is a species of parrot in the family Psittaculidae. It is endemic to Norfolk Island (located between Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia in the Tasman Sea). The species was once considered a subspecies of the red-fronted parakeet of New Zealand. The name Tasman parakeet is used by Christidis and Boles on the argument that this species and the Lord Howe red-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae subflavescens) are probably a single species for which they use biogeographical arguments. Tasman is used for other species with the same distribution and they propose that name for that reason. However, the latter subspecies was not included in the genus-wide phylogenetic reconstruction using DNA sequences, and the lumping of the species should be considered tentative. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and plantations. It is threatened by habitat loss. This species of parakeet was down to only 4 breeding females and 28–33 males in 1994, but its population has since rebounded to 200–300 birds.

"The mydid fly genus Rhaphiomidas contains fewer than 30 species/subspecies, all of them occurring in the desert regions of the southwestern United States and adjacent portions of northwestern Mexico. The adults are most commonly encountered in sand dune areas, and are typically only active for a few weeks each year, either in the spring or the fall; in some cases, more than one species can occur in the same dune system, but they are allochronic, each flying in different seasons. Almost nothing is known about their biology, though eggs or early instar larvae of some species are laid on the soil surface and appear to be attractive to ants, and are brought into the ant nest (it therefore seems likely that the larvae are predators of the ant brood). The restriction to sand dune areas has unfortunately led a number of these flies to the brink of extinction, especially both subspecies of R. terminatus, and the species R. trochilus. While there is only one of these on the Endangered Species List (Rhaphiomidas terminatus abdominalis, a.k.a. the \""Delhi Sands Flower-loving fly\""), many of the remaining taxa - including a few that have not yet been named - are gravely imperiled, as they are restricted to small geographic areas (less than 500 square miles (1,300 km2), sometimes much less), rendering them extremely vulnerable to habitat loss or disturbance. These habitats are heavily targeted for development, and even if not, activities such as sand mining or motorized off-roading are common, and render the habitat unsuitable for the survival of the flies. The family affiliation of the genus has changed fairly recently, as it had been previously placed in the family Apioceridae, or \""flower-loving flies\"" - but, despite the transfer, the name \""flower-loving flies\"" is nonetheless still used to refer to various species of Rhaphiomidas.",nature,7

The spiny scallop lives on the seabed in the sublittoral zone between low tide mark and a depth of 150 metres (490 ft), on soft sediment or on rock, particularly in areas with a strong current. It is a filter feeder, sieving microscopic algae from water that passes though its gills. It is preyed on by starfish, octopuses and sea otters. It can detect predators by smell and by sight and can swim away from them by opening and closing its valves. Other organisms often grow on the exterior of its shell and it often forms a symbiotic relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on the upper valve and helps protect it from predators.",nature,7

"The Sichuan treecreeper (Certhia tianquanensis) is a rare species of bird in the treecreeper family, Certhiidae. It was described as new to science (initially as a subspecies of the common treecreeper C. familiaris) in 1995 from 14 specimens taken at four sites in the mountains of western Sichuan, China. In 2002, it was realized that these birds constituted a distinct species, and subsequent research suggests it is closest to the Nepal treecreeper (C. nipalensis). This species is believed to be a relict species breeding in open old-growth stands of the conifer Faber's fir (Abies fabri) at high altitude (2,500-2,830 m), although it is thought to undertake localised altitudinal migrations in the winter (occurring down to at least 1,600 m). It is known from five sites: Labahe Natural Reserve (Tianquin County), Dayi County, Shuanghe town (Ebian County), Wawu Shan (Hongya County), and Wujipung in Wolong Biosphere Reserve. Within this small area, the species is thought to be patchily distributed because it seems to be confined to old stands of the Faber's fir. The species forages for invertebrates in the upper storey of large trees by creeping along branches and trunks. Intensive logging of primary coniferous forests in the last century, even at high altitudes in the mountains of western China, has seriously reduced the potential range of this species. The Wawu Shan table mountain has steep slopes which are inaccessible to lumberjacks in the absence of extensive road construction, but it is not yet formally protected, and there are plans to open up the regions for tourism by building a cable railway. The population was estimated at less than 1000 adult individuals, occurring over a range of 19,690 km2. Formerly classified as vulnerable species by the IUCN, new research has shown it to be not as rare as it was believed. Consequently, it is downlisted to near threatened status in 2008.",nature,7

"Hoplosuchus is a genus of crocodylomorph. It is so far only known definitely from one specimen, a skeleton collected from sandstone of the Upper Jurassic-age Morrison Formation rocks at Dinosaur National Monument, Utah, during road construction. The individual was small, approximately 20 centimetres (7.9 in) long, although it may have been very young. It is perhaps the basalmost known crocodylomorph of the Morrison Formation, as suggested by such attributes as still having antorbital fenestrae in the skull. The limbs were relatively long, suggesting that the animal was terrestrial. Two rows of bony scutes ran down the back. The crowns of the teeth are not well preserved, so the diet cannot be determined with certainty. Given its small size, it probably ate insects and small vertebrates; it may have been carnivorous or omnivorous. Charles W. Gilmore named Hoplosuchus in 1926; the type species is H. kayi. He described it as an aetosaur, a type of armored herbivorous archosaur related to the crocodylomorphs, but it was later reevaluated as a crocodylomorph itself. Sometimes classified as an atoposaurid, a 1988 review of atoposaurids found it more likely to be a protosuchian-grade crocodylomorph.

"Abies homolepis, the Nikko fir (in Japanese ウラジロモミ, urajiro-momi) is a fir native to the mountains of central and southern Honshū and Shikoku, Japan. It grows at altitudes of 700–2,200 m, often in temperate rain forest with high rainfall and cool, humid summers, and heavy winter snowfall. It is a medium-sized to large evergreen coniferous tree growing to 30–40 m tall with a trunk diameter of up to 1.5 m. The leaves are needle-like, flattened, 1.5–3.5 cm long and 2–3 mm wide by 0.5 mm thick, glossy green above, and with two white bands of stomata below, and rounded or slightly notched at the tip. The leaf arrangement is spiral on the shoot, but with each leaf variably twisted at the base so they lie partially flattened to either side of and above the shoot, with few below the shoot. The shoots are yellow-buff, glabrous, and often conspicuously grooved. The cones are 6–12 cm long and 3–4 cm broad, purple-blue before maturity; the scale bracts are short, and hidden in the closed cone.

"The red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonaria) is a species of tortoises from northern South America. These medium-sized tortoises generally average 30 cm (12 in) as adults, but can reach over 40 cm (16 in). They have dark-colored, loaf-shaped carapaces (back shell) with a lighter patch in the middle of each scute (scales on the shell), and dark limbs with brightly colored scales that range from pale yellow to dark red. Recognized differences are seen between red-footed tortoises from different regions. They are closely related to the yellow-footed tortoise (C. denticulata) from the Amazon Basin. They are popularly kept as pets, and over-collection has caused them to be vulnerable to extinction. Their natural habitat ranges from savannah to forest edges around the Amazon Basin. They are omnivorous with a diet based on a wide assortment of plants, mostly fruit when available, but also including grasses, flowers, fungi, carrion, and invertebrates. They do not brumate, but may aestivate in hot, dry weather. Eggs, hatchlings, and young tortoises are food for many predators, but the main threats for adults are jaguars and humans. Population density ranges from locally common to very scarce due in part to habitat destruction and over-collection for food and the pet trade.",nature,7

With a surface area of 1.47 square kilometres (0.57 sq mi) and holding 21,772,000 cubic metres (4.789×109 imp gal) of water it is Yorkshire Water's largest reservoir. The original reservoir was built in 1864 by the Bradford Corporation, the Local Authority for the city of Bradford, approximately 300 metres (980 ft) above sea level in Wharfedale. Following an agreement made in 1970 the size of the reservoir was increased by seven times and the water level was raised by 20 metres (66 ft), with work starting in 1976 and being completed in 1983. The reservoir outlet is the site of a renewable energy project that saw the installation of a small turbine that generates 1400 MWh of electricity per annum. The reservoir is an important area for birds and is home to wildfowl such as Eurasian wigeon, teal, greylag geese and Canada geese. Other birds that can be seen at various times in the area include ringed plover, northern lapwing, common redshank, Eurasian curlew, reed bunting, lesser redpoll, whinchat and sedge warbler.

"The Malayan flying frog, Rhacophorus prominanus, is a species of frog in the moss frog family (Rhacophoridae). It is found in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. This is a largish flying frog, with females growing to a body length of up to 7.6 cm (about 3 in), and males reaching up to 6.2 cm in body length. It is generally jade green on the back and somewhat translucent when small, and a prominent red blotch on the webbing extends between the third and fifth hind toes. Tadpoles are greyish green and have no markings. Towards metamorphosis, they become greener. They lose their tails when they are about 30–33 mm long, and freshly emergent juveniles measure about 15 mm. The labial tooth row formula (LTRF) is 5(2-5)/3 in small tadpoles and 6(2-6)/3 in older ones. Its natural habitats are subtropical and tropical moist montane forests above 600 meters ASL, where it inhabits rivers, intermittent rivers, and intermittent freshwater marshes. It is not considered threatened by the IUCN, which classify it as a Species of Least Concern. However, the IUCN followed a recent study, according to which Rhacophorus tunkui was a junior synonym of R. prominanus. This synonymy was later criticized for severe methodological flaws: \""... the justifications provided by Harvey et al. (2002) were insufficient and unconvincing, especially when type material of both R. prominanus and R. tunkui were not even examined.\"" It appears as if R. tunkui is indeed a distinct lowland sister species of the Malayan flying frog, about two-thirds of the length of the latter, and differing in some coloration details. Its tadpoles have two or three prominent black spots on each side of the tail base. While more research seems warranted, at present these frogs are better considered two species for the time being. It is not known how the range restriction of the Malayan flying frog to montane habitat would affect its conservation status; technically both taxa would more appropriately be considered as \""data deficient\"".",nature,7

The largest monitor lizard in New Guinea, it is believed to be one of the longest lizards in the world, verified at up to 244 cm (8 ft), and in rare cases it may rival or exceed the length of the world's largest lizard, the Komodo dragon. It is the sole member of the subgenus Papusaurus. V. salvadorii is an arboreal lizard with a dark green body and yellowish bands, a blunt snout and a very long tail. It lives in mangrove swamps and coastal rainforests in the southeastern part of the island, where it feeds on birds, small mammals, eggs, and carrion in the wild, using teeth better adapted than those of most monitors for seizing fast-moving prey. Like all monitors, it has anatomical features that enable it to breathe more easily when running than other lizards can, and V. salvadorii may have greater stamina than most monitors. Little is known of its reproduction and development, as the species is very difficult to breed in captivity.

"Palaelodus is an extinct genus of birds distantly related to flamingos. They were slender birds with long, thin legs and a long neck. Little is known about the shape of their skull or beak. Some paleontologists think Palaelodus was able to swim under water, chasing prey, but the morphology of their feet seems not very well adapted for diving. Rather, it is more likely that they were adapted to browsing for food while swimming or standing in shallow water. The family, Palaelodidae, is the sister taxon of modern flamingos, and the order Phoenicopteriformes, to which both belong, probably evolved from a grebe-like ancestor. It is easy to see how a bird like Palaelodus represents an intermediate form between a diving, fish-eating grebe and a wading, invertebrate-filtering flamingo. This does not mean that the palaelodids are the ancestors of the flamingos. Rather, they were a sister group that remained in the ecological niche of their common ancestor.",nature,7
"Lac du Ballon is a reservoir in Haut-Rhin, France. It's situated in a side valley of florival, on the slope of Grand Ballon mountain. At an elevation of 988 m, its surface area is 0.08 km². The small glacial lake was enlarged by a dam on the moraine already in the 16th century. In 1699, Vauban had it refurbished to supply canals for the building of Neuf-Brisach. The remainders of this dam were destroyed by flooding in 1740 and 1778. In 1869, manufacturers dug a gallery to the lake bottom to increase the usable water height. Until 1955, the rock ground became leaky. 1966–1968 the lake was tightened, the dam heightened again, with a flood spillway at the left end. The old gallery was backfilled, a new bottom outlet with a valve tower built.In 2000, the dam and the lake shore were masoned, the dam top fixed with concrete.

"The Dactyloidae are a family of lizards commonly known as anoles /əˈnoʊliːz/. The NCBI places the anole in subfamily Polychrotinae of the family Iguanidae. The family is generally considered to be monotypic, containing only the genus Anolis; however, recent genetic research has identified several clades within Anolis that may sometimes be elevated to generic status. These clades are: Dactyloa, Deiroptyx, Ctenonotus, Xiphosurus, Norops, Chamaelinorops, Anolis (exclusive of the other recognized monophyletic clades) and Audantia. The genus Polychrus was previously also placed in the family under the family name Polychrotidae; however recent genetic studies confirm that Polychrus is not closely related to Anolis and is in fact closer to Hoplocercidae. Therefore, Polychrotidae as a family has been invalidated, which classifies Polychrus under subfamily Polychrotinae and family Iguanidae. Due to their ability to change color, anolis (anole) lizards are frequently referred to as American chameleons. Anolis lizards also share many characteristics with geckos. However anoles are not closely related to either of those groups, they are most closely related to iguanas. Anoles share many anatomical features with arboreal iguanas.

The male is about 20 cm (8 in) long and has a grey head, a black crest and breast, and a grey or olive brown body. The female and juvenile are similar but the colours are more muted and the black breast is lacking. The distinctive call is a high pitched bell-like sound, audible at some distance. Sometimes a pair of birds duet. The crested bellbird feeds on seeds and small invertebrates, foraging on the ground or in low bushes. The deep, cup-shaped nest is usually within a couple of metres of the ground, built in the fork of a branch or in a crevice in a stump. It is made from small twigs and bark and lined with finer material. Up to four eggs are laid and these are incubated by both parents.

"The yellowtail snapper, Ocyurus chrysurus, is an abundant species of snapper native to the western Atlantic Ocean including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. Although they have been found as far north as Massachusetts, their normal range is along Florida south to the West Indies and Brazil. This species is mostly found around coral reefs, but may be found in other habitats. They occur at depths of from near the surface to 180 metres (590 ft), though mostly between 10 and 70 m (33 and 230 ft). This species can reach a length of 86.3 cm (34.0 in), though most do not exceed 40 cm (16 in). The greatest weight recorded for this species is 4.1 kg (9.0 lb). It is a commercially important species and has been farmed. It is sought as a game fish by recreational anglers and is a popular species for display in public aquaria. This species is the only known member of its genus. In certain reefs, most notably in the Florida Keys, this beautifully colored fish is commonly spotted among divers and snorkelers. Yellowtails feed on shrimp, crabs, worms, and smaller fish. They spawn in groups off the edges of reefs from spring to fall, but heavily in midsummer. Yellowtail snapper are typically caught in 30–120 ft of water on and around reefs and other structure. The most common method of catching them is with hook and line, and the use of frozen chum, typically leftover ground fish parts, to attract the fish. The chum is placed into a mesh bag or metal basket in the water, and as the chum slowly melts, small pieces of fish drift out and down towards the bottom, where the yellowtails typically feed. The chum keeps them near the boat for extended periods of time, as well. Light tackle is the generally accepted means of catching yellowtail snapper. Typically, the fish are relatively wary of higher-test or thicker line, and larger hooks. Most fish caught by anglers range from eight to 14 in, although catches to 16 in are not uncommon. Yellowtail snapper can be caught on a variety of baits, including both live and frozen shrimp, squid, and a variety of live and frozen minnows or smaller baitfish. Yellowtail tend to be wary fish, and the appearance of larger predators, such as dolphins or sharks, can scare off schools until the predator leaves the area. Most anglers pursue yellowtail snapper during the warmer months, but they can be caught throughout the year. Yellowtail snapper is highly prized for its light, flaky meat and is considered by some to be one of the best of the snapper family.",nature,7

The family also includes the North American birds known as juncos and towhees. It was hypothesized that the family Emberizidae may have originated in South America and spread first into North America before crossing into eastern Asia and continuing to move west. This would explain the comparative paucity of emberizid species in Europe and Africa compared to the Americas.  However, a DNA sequence-based study of passerines concluded emberizids spread from North to South America. As with several other passerine families, the taxonomic treatment of this family's members is currently in a state of flux.

The separated gonopod remains attached to the female's epigynum for approximately 4 hours and continues to function independently, serving as a mating plug. While this happens, the female feeds on the male. Emasculation thus synchronizes sexual cannibalism and sperm transfer, lengthening the interval between copulations. This mating behaviour might allow for the continuation of insemination by the dismembered palp.",nature,7

"Lake Maury is a reservoir which was created as part of the natural park on the grounds of the Mariners' Museum located in the independent city of Newport News in the Hampton Roads region of southeastern Virginia. The museum was founded in 1932 by Archer Milton Huntington, son of Collis P. Huntington, a railroad builder who brought the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway to Warwick County, Virginia, and who founded the City of Newport News, its coal export facilities, and Newport News Shipbuilding in the late 19th century. Archer and his wife, the sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington, acquired 800 acres (3.2 km²) of land that would come to hold 61,000 square feet (5,700 m²) of exhibition galleries, a research library, a 167-acre (676,000 m²) lake, a five-mile (8 km) shoreline trail with fourteen bridges, and over 35,000 maritime artifacts from around the globe. After acquisition took place, the first two years were devoted to creating and improving a natural park and constructing a dam to create Lake Maury, which was named after the nineteenth-century Virginian Commodore Matthew Fontaine Maury, who was nicknamed the \""Father of Modern Oceanography\"". The Museum’s collection is of an international scope and includes 35,000 artifacts. There are 10 permanent galleries, changing and traveling exhibits, and virtual galleries available through the museum website. The Mariners' Museum is home to the U.S.S. Monitor Center, which officially opened on March 9, 2007, and includes display of a full-scale replica of the ironclad warship Monitor, the original recovered turret, and many artifacts and related items.

"The white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura), also known as the snow quail, is the smallest bird in the grouse family. It is a permanent resident of high altitudes on or above the tree line and is native to Alaska and the mountainous parts of Canada and the western United States. It has also been introduced into the Sierra Nevada in California, the Wallowa Mountains in Oregon and the Uinta Mountains in Utah. Its plumage is cryptic and varies at different times of the year. In the summer it is speckled in gray, brown and white whereas in winter it is wholly white. At all times of year the wings, belly and tail are white. The white-tailed ptarmigan has a diet of buds, leaves, flowers and seeds. The nest is a simple depression in the ground in which up to 8 eggs are laid. After hatching, the chicks soon leave the nest. At first they eat insects but later move on to an adult diet, their mother using vocalisations to help them find suitable plant food. The population seems to be stable and the IUCN lists this species as being of \""Least Concern\"".",nature,7
"Lybia is a genus of small crabs in the family Xanthidae. Their common names include boxer crabs, boxing crabs and pom-pom crabs. They are notable for their mutualism with sea anemones, which they hold in their claws for defense. In return, the anemones get carried around which may enable them to capture more food particles with their tentacles. Boxer crabs use at least three different species of anemones, including Bundeopsis spp. and Triactis producta. The bonding with the anemone is not required for survival, however, and boxer crabs have frequently been known to live without them, sometimes substituting other organisms such as sponges and corals for the sea anemones. The genus Lybia contains the following species: \n* Lybia australiensis (Ward, 1933) \n* Lybia caestifera (Alcock, 1898) \n* Lybia denticulata Nobili, 1905 \n* Lybia edmondsoni Takeda & Miyake, 1970 \n* Lybia hatagumoana Sakai, 1961 \n* Lybia leptochelis (Zehntner, 1894) \n* Lybia plumosa Barnard, 1947 \n* Lybia pugil (Alcock, 1898) \n* Lybia tessellata (Latreille in Milbert, 1812) \n* Lybia tutelina C.

"Athrotaxis laxifolia is a species of Athrotaxis, endemic to Tasmania in Australia, where it grows at 1,000–1,200 m altitude. It is an evergreen coniferous tree growing to 10–20 m tall, with a trunk up to 1 m diameter. The leaves are scale-like, 4–12 mm long and 2–3 mm broad, arranged spirally on the shoots. The seed cones are oblong-globose, 15–26 mm long and 14–20 mm diameter, with 14–18 spirally-arranged scales; they are mature about six months after pollination. The pollen cones are 3–5 mm long. Its status in the wild is little-known; it is the rarest of the three species of Athrotaxis. It is in many respects intermediate between Athrotaxis cupressoides and Athrotaxis selaginoides, and it is strongly suspected of being a natural hybrid between these two; however, genetic evidence for this is inconclusive. Away from its native range, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental tree in northwestern Europe.

"The blue-fronted lorikeet (Charmosyna toxopei) also known as the Buru lorikeet, is a parrot endemic to the Indonesian island of Buru. The first foreign scientist who described the blue-fronted lorikeet and the only one who managed to capture it (seven individuals in the 1920s, using lime) was the Java-born Dutch lepidopterist Lambertus Johannes Toxopeus, which is reflected in the Latin name of the bird. His observations were summarized by the Dutch ornithologist Hendrik Cornelis Siebers (1890–1949) in 1930. Toxopeus noted that the bird's habitat on Buru is likely restricted to the western part of the Rana plateau in the center of the island (settlements of Wa Temun, Wa Fehat and Nal Besi), as the local name of the bird, utu papua, was not known anywhere else on the island. Two indigenous hunters caught blue-fronted lorikeets for food north-west from the Rana lake, but the bird was not found in the mangroves of the Kayeli Bay at the eastern part of Buru. The locals living at the Rana plateau reported that the bird feeds on nectar and pollen of the flowering trees. Toxopeus found the bird at elevations of 840–1,000 m (2,760–3,280 ft). Four blue-fronted lorikeets were observed in the 1980s, in very different areas at the north-western (Bara settlement) and southern coasts of Buru, at a coconut plantation and in a disturbed lowland forest between the coastal farming fields and the base of the nearby hills. Flocks of several birds were found in another area at elevation of 600 meters (2,000 ft). In November 2014, it was rediscovered and the first photographs were published by birders from BirdQuest in the internet. The analysis of all observations suggested that the blue-fronted lorikeet preferably inhabits forests at the altitude of several hundred meters. The blue-fronted lorikeets usually live in pairs, but may form groups up to 10 individuals. They grow to about 16 cm (6.3 in). The voice was described by Toxopeus as a ti–ti–ti–ti–tititi shrill, but might be related not to the blue-fronted lorikeet, but to the red-flanked lorikeet (Charmosyna placentis) which was later observed in the same area. In nature the blue-fronted lorikeets feed on flowering trees of the Myrtaceae family, and in captivity they consumed bananas and milk. The anecdotal character of their observation and very limited habitat, which is gradually shrinking due to logging, urged the International Union for Conservation of Nature to gradually elevate its status from threatened in 1988 to vulnerable in 1994 and critically endangered since 2000. The establishment of two protected areas on Buru, Gunung Kapalat Mada (1,380 km²) and Waeapo (50 km²), partly aim at preserving the habitat of the blue-fronted lorikeet.",nature,7

"The Antilles pinktoe tarantula (Avicularia versicolor), also known as the Martinique red tree spider or the Martinique pinktoe, is native to Guadeloupe, Dominica and Martinique in the Caribbean Sea. It is popular as a spider pet because of its docile character and unique coloration. Antilles pinktoe tarantulas are arboreal (tree-dwelling). They spin elaborate funnel webs in which they spend most of their time. Accordingly, in captivity, cage height is much more important than floor space. Decor consists of tree branches or cork pieces to which the spider can attach its web. Spiderlings of A. versicolor are bright blue, with a black tree trunk pattern on the abdomen. As they grow, they gradually lose their blue coloration; the carapace turns green, the abdomen red, and the legs turn green with pink tarsi and a covering of purple hairs. The species is in general more colorful than the related Pinktoe tarantula. Males usually are slightly more brightly colored than females. As in most tarantula species, males do not grow as large as females, and their abdomens are smaller than those of females, even in proportion to their size.",nature,7

"Galbula is the type and largest genus of the jacamar family (Galbulidae) of piciform birds, and its suborder Galbulae. Sometimes, the Piciformes are split in two, with the Galbulae upranked to full order Galbuliformes. They are smallish to mid-sized forest birds of the Neotropics, with long pointed bills, elongated tails, and small feet. Colored in metallic iridescent hues – typically greenish – at least on the upperside, some have a red or brownish belly. Males and females are generally similar in appearance, but in most species differ in minor plumage details. As usual for Piciformes, they nest in burrows they dig out themselves. In the case of this genus, nests are dug in earthen banks along rivers or roads, or in termitaria. As with other jacamars but otherwise unknown among Piciformes, their chicks do not hatch naked. They have a piping song and feed in typical jacamar fashion, by catching flying arthropods, typically larger insects such has butterflies.

"The peter pepper, Capsicum annuum var. annuum, is an heirloom chili pepper that is best known for its unusual shape. It is a type of Capsicum annuum, though it is not officially recognized as a cultivar of the species. It occurs in red and yellow varieties. The pepper is considered very rare, and its origin is unknown. The pepper is most commonly grown in East Texas and Louisiana, although it is grown in Mexico, as well. It was first popularized in the United States by Frank X. Tolbert in his Dallas Morning News column about obscure local history, although he saw the pepper only once in his life. It has since been studied by horticulture experts at the University of Texas at Austin and Louisiana State University. Though it is rare, its seeds are available from some private suppliers. It is adaptable to a variety of growing conditions. The seeds have also been exported to Asian countries, including South Korea. The pepper has often been noted for its phallic appearance when fully grown. The pepper, particularly the red variety, has been described as a \""miniature replica of the uncircumcised male organ\"". The pod of the pepper is wrinkled and has a round tip with a cleft. It is approximately 3 to 4 inches in length, and 1 to 1.5 inches wide when fully mature. The pod of the pepper has also been noted for its pungency. As it has a very high Scoville rating, the pepper has been suggested for ornamental use rather than human consumption. It is sometimes pickled, though. It was described by Frank X. Tolbert, a Texas journalist, historian, and chili enthusiast in one of his columns called \""Tolbert's Texas\"" he wrote for the Dallas Morning News. Jean Andrews, in her book Peppers: the domesticated Capsicums, states the peter pepper did have all the qualifications \""to be honored by the pen\"" of Mr. Tolbert, who wrote about \""little-known facts about little-known things that occur in little-known places in Texas\"". Ms. Andrews described how hard it was to get the seed of this \""little-known things that occur in little-known places\"" that she needed to study, but eventually she got the seeds, and was amused to see how \""resulting pods naturally and consistently contorted themselves into a miniature replica of the circumcised male organ.\""",nature,7

"Pinus × sondereggeri is the only named southern pine hybrid. Common names include Sonderegger pine and bastard pine. It is a naturally occurring cross between loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and longleaf pine (Pinus palustris). It was originally described by H. H. Chapman (1922) who named it after its discoverer, V. H. Sonderegger, a state forester of Louisiana. This pine usually occurs singly or in small groups where both loblolly and longleaf pines overlap in range. Because the flowering of both parental trees usually occur at the same time of year, no phenological barrier exists, thus the two freely cross. Tree characteristics are normally intermediate between loblolly and longleaf. Sonderegger pine is not resistant to fusiform rust like its parent, longleaf pine. Because this hybrid pine possesses heavy limbs and long-needled foliage like the longleaf pine, one may confuse Sonderegger pine with longleaf pine. However, the striped brown bud of Sonderegger is a distinguishing characteristic, as Longleaf possesses a white bud. Also, intermediate in size, the cone is armed similarly to a cone of the Loblolly pine. Because no grass stage exists for this hybrid, it has significant height growth during the first year. Thus, it is easily detected in uniform plantings of longleaf pine. Also called bastard pine, Sonderegger pine may have qualities superior to those of its parents. Differences in wood properties are not significant when compared to random samples of the two parent species. Tracheid length might be slightly shorter than either parent, even though tracheid length in southern pines usually does not differ significantly.",nature,7

"Chardonnay (pronounced: [ʃaʁ.dɔ.nɛ]) is a green-skinned grape variety used to make white wine. It originated in the Burgundy wine region of eastern France, but is now grown wherever wine is produced, from England to New Zealand. For new and developing wine regions, growing Chardonnay is seen as a \""rite of passage\"" and an easy entry into the international wine market. The Chardonnay grape itself is very neutral, with many of the flavors commonly associated with the grape being derived from such influences as terroir and oak. It is vinified in many different styles, from the lean, crisply mineral wines of Chablis, France, to New World wines with oak, and tropical fruit flavors. In cool climates (such as Chablis and the Carneros AVA of California), Chardonnay tends to be medium to light body with noticeable acidity and flavors of green plum, apple, and pear. In warmer locations (such as the Adelaide Hills and Mornington Peninsula in Australia and Gisborne and Marlborough region of New Zealand), the flavors become more citrus, peach, and melon, while in very warm locations (such as the Central Coast AVA of California), more fig and tropical fruit notes such as banana and mango come out. Wines that have gone through malolactic fermentation tend to have softer acidity and fruit flavors with buttery mouthfeel and hazelnut notes. Chardonnay is an important component of many sparkling wines around the world, including Champagne. A peak in popularity in the late 1980s gave way to a backlash among those wine connoisseur who saw the grape as a leading negative component of the globalization of wine. Nonetheless, it remains one of the most widely planted grape varieties, with over 160,000 hectares (400,000 acres) worldwide, second only to Airén among white wine grapes and planted in more wine regions than any other grape – including Cabernet Sauvignon.",nature,7

"Dabry's sturgeon (Acipenser dabryanus) is a species of fish in the sturgeon family, Acipenseridae. Other common names include Yangtze sturgeon, Chiangjiang sturgeon, and river sturgeon. It is endemic to the Yangtze River Basin in China. It was a food fish of commercial importance. Its populations declined drastically, and in the early 1980s, it was designated an endangered species and commercial harvest was banned. It has been listed as a critically endangered species by the IUCN since 1996. This sturgeon has been known to reach 2.5 m in length, but it is usually much smaller. Its body is blue-gray above and yellowish white on the belly, with five rows of scutes. The head is triangular and the snout is long with the mouth located on the underside. There are two pairs of barbels. The fish lives in slow-moving river waters over substrates of sand and mud. It feeds on aquatic plants, invertebrates, and small fish. This species is potamodromous, taking part in a migration, but never leaving fresh water. It spawns in the upper Yangtze, mainly during March and April, and sometimes around November and December. Males spawn each year, but most females do not. The female produces 57,000 to 102,000 eggs. This was once a common fish in the Yangtze system. It was known from the main river and some of its larger tributaries, as well as some lakes attached to the system. By the late 20th century, it was extirpated from the lower river and limited to the upper reaches in Sichuan. The main causes of its drastic decline include overfishing, including the overharvesting of juveniles. The construction of dams, such as the Three Gorges Dam, blocked the movement of the fish along the river, restricting it to the upper reaches. It also caused habitat fragmentation and degradation.

"Trustom Pond is a closed lagoon in South Kingstown, Washington County, Rhode Island, United States. It is one of nine coastal lagoons (referred to as \""salt ponds\"" by locals) in southern Rhode Island. It has a surface area of 800 acres (320 ha), and is the only undeveloped salt pond in the state. The pond averages 1.3 feet (0.40 m) deep, and has a salinity level of 5 parts per thousand. It is non-tidal, except when breached by storms. The water directly receives about 219,844,022 US gallons (832,200,150 L) of precipitation per year, with an estimated 796,215 US gallons (3,014,000 L) in daily groundwater flow. No streams flow into the pond, though a nearby stream \""captures water that otherwise would have flowed to Trustom Pond\"". Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge is a National Wildlife Refuge, inhabited by over 300 species of birds, 40 species of mammals, and 20 species of reptiles and amphibians. As such, it is a popular bird-watching destination. In 1987, 365 acres (148 ha) of land were donated to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; subsequent donations and purchases raised the protected area to 800 acres (320 ha), with current plans for expansion. The wildlife refuge receives approximately 50,000 visitors annually. The Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge includes 3 miles (4.8 km) of foot trails, surrounded by fields, shrublands, woodlands and small freshwater ponds. Wildlife managers create breachways to the Block Island Sound, lowering water levels and creating mudflats which become feeding areas for waders.",nature,7

"The Triglidae, commonly known as sea robins or gurnard, are a family of bottom-feeding scorpaeniform fish. They get their name (sea robin) from the orange ventral surface of the species in the Western Atlantic (Prionotus carolinus) and from large pectoral fins, which, when swimming, open and close like a bird's wings in flight. The large surface area of the fins also permits the fish to glide short distances above the water surface, much like a flying fish. They are bottom-dwelling fish, living down to 200 m (660 ft), although they can be found in much shallower water. Most species are around 30 to 40 cm (12 to 16 in) in length. They have an unusually solid skull, and many species also possess armored plates on their bodies. Another distinctive feature is the presence of a \""drumming muscle\"" that makes sounds by beating against the swim bladder. When caught, they make a croaking noise similar to a frog, which has given them the onomatopoeic name gurnard. Sea robins have six spiny \""legs\"", three on each side. These legs are actually flexible spines that were once part of the pectoral fin. During development, the spines separate from the rest of the fin, developing into feeler-like \""forelegs\"". The pectoral fins have been thought to let the fish \""walk\"" on the bottom, but are really used to explore the bottom in search of food.

"The Sunapee golden trout, Salvelinus alpinus oquassa, or blueback trout, is a subspecies of Arctic char native to the northeast United States, Québec, and New Brunswick. The Sunapee trout is often a foot long and is said to actually be silver in color. It is an distinct strain of Arctic char, having become trapped (by changed drainage systems and climates) in numerous lakes and ponds in New England and southeastern Québec. The lake for which this subspecies is most noted for is Sunapee Lake in New Hampshire. In the wake of the retreating glacial front approximately 8,000 years ago, following the end of the last ice age, the Arctic char, an extremely coldwater, anadromous fish, was still spawning in New England. After the climate changed sufficiently, anadromous Arctic char stopped spawning in New England, leaving several lacustrine populations or Arctic char cut off from the bulk of the species in deep, cold, clear lakes in New Hampshire, Maine, and Québec. The lake populations of Arctic char in Maine are termed \""blueback trout,\"" those in Québec are termed \""Québec red trout,\"" and the populations that used to exist in Vermont and New Hampshire along with the current population in Floods Pond, Maine, are termed Sunapee golden trout. By the late 19th century, as the New Hampshire and Vermont lakes developed its own steady summer tourism, recreational fishermen who sought to increase their catches began to introduce new fish species into these lakes, and these eventually overwhelmed the native Sunapee golden trout. Lake trout, a larger char that holds the same ecological niche as Sunapee trout, only better, out-competed the Sunapee golden trout and hybridized with it, further accelerating its decline. The world record Sunapee golden trout was most likely a hybrid between the two species. Soon after that record-setting catch, the Sunapee golden trout could no longer be found in its resident lakes. The Sunapee Lake strain of the Sunapee trout was rediscovered in 1977 when Kent Ball, of Idaho Fish and Game, discovered a char species living with brook trout in a mountain lake in Idaho. Analysis by Robert Benhke, Eric Wagner, and Steve Culver proved the species to be the sunapee trout. Later research found reports of a trout egg trade between the Idaho and the New Hampshire Fish and Game departments. They are reported found in two Idaho bodies of water, Alice and Sawtooth Lakes. DNA analysis done in the latter half of the twentieth century on museum specimens of the Sunapee lake strain of the Sunapee golden trout found that all lacustrine populations of Arctic char in north eastern North America have been isolated from each other for near equal amounts of time, indicating that there is no special, distinguishing characteristics between the Sunapee trout of New Hampshire and Vermont and the blueback trout of northern Maine.",nature,7

"Cambridge University Ice Hockey Club at the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England, is one of the oldest ice hockey teams in the world. While the team claims a history dating back to 1885, the first strong evidence for their existence comes on 16 March 1900, when they played Oxford University Ice Hockey Club in the first Ice Hockey Varsity Match, at Princes Skating Club in London, losing 7–6. This match was played, on Oxford's insistence, with bandy sticks and a lacrosse ball. The Cambridge team was led by J. J. Cawthra, who later played for England. The following day, the two universities joined together to play Princes Ice Hockey Club. Cambridge played a second varsity match at Princes in 1901, this time winning 6–5. In 1903, they entered the first ice hockey league in Europe, but came last out of the five teams competing. The squad then switched to playing European tours, popularising the sport, and from 1909 to 1913 and 1920 onwards playing an annual varsity match. From 1932, these matches were played in England, and although no longer able to compete with the top professional sides, they were watched by over 10,000 supporters. In 1931, the club joined the English League, but when it finished in 1936 they did not follow most of the teams into the English National League, instead joining the lower-level London and Provincial League in 1938. In 1948, they played a season in the Southern Intermediate League, and in the 1970s they played two seasons in the Southern League. They then joined the Inter-City League and finally played in the inaugural season of the British Hockey League.

It was held at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, on 10 August 2003. The match was played between Manchester United, champions of the 2002–03 Premier League and Arsenal, who beat Southampton 1–0 in the 2003 FA Cup Final. Manchester United won the Shield 4–3 on penalties, after the match finished 1–1 after 90 minutes. This was Manchester United's 22nd Community Shield appearance and Arsenal's 17th. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson assessed before the match that his midfield was stronger than before, despite selling first-team players David Beckham and Juan Sebastián Verón. Arsène Wenger was optimistic of Arsenal's prospects in the upcoming season despite having only made minor changes to his squad, and Chelsea's emergence as a competitor following Roman Abramovich's takeover. Having been linked with a transfer away during the summer, Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira revealed before the game his intention to stay at the club. Goalkeepers Tim Howard and Jens Lehmann made their competitive debuts for their respective clubs in the match. Ole Gunnar Solskjær started in midfield for Manchester United, with Paul Scholes playing behind the main striker, Ruud van Nistelrooy. For Arsenal, Kolo Touré partnered Sol Campbell in central defence as Martin Keown was absent.

In the second half, substitute Francis Jeffers was sent off for kicking out at Phil Neville. Neither team was able to score in the remaining time, so the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. Howard saved the decisive spot-kick taken by Robert Pirès. Both managers were pleased with their teams' performances, in particular Ferguson, who felt his players coped well in the heat.

"The 1930 Alabama Crimson Tide football team (variously \""Alabama\"", \""UA\"" or \""Bama\"") represented the University of Alabama in the 1930 college football season. It was the Crimson Tide's 37th overall and 9th season as a member of the Southern Conference (SoCon). The team was led by head coach Wallace Wade, in his eighth year, and played their home games at Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, at Legion Field in Birmingham, and at the Cramton Bowl in Montgomery, Alabama. They finished the season with a perfect record (10–0 overall, 8–0 in the SoCon), as Southern Conference champions and as national champions after they defeated Washington State in the Rose Bowl. In April 1930, coach Wade announced his resignation effective at the end of the 1930 season, and his last Alabama team might have been his best. For psychological effect, Wade routinely started games with his second team, and the backups never allowed a point. The first team defense only allowed the opposition to score 13 points over the course of the season en route to a 9–0 record. Only the Vanderbilt game was close, as the Commodores scored a late touchdown that cut Alabama's lead to five in their 12–7 loss. Vanderbilt's touchdown and a touchdown scored by Tennessee accounted for all of the scoring by Alabama's opponents in 1930. Alabama received its third Rose Bowl invitation in six seasons, this time against the also undefeated Cougars of Washington State. In the game, Wade started his second team. Once again, the second team did not allow any points and neither did the first team in their 24–0 victory. The win clinched the second perfect season in school history after 1925, and the Crimson Tide claimed the 1930 national championship along with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Johnny Cain starred at fullback, and in the days of iron man football also handled linebacker, and punting duties. He was later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Other players from the 1930 Alabama team included Fred Sington, who went on to play baseball for the Washington Senators and Frank Howard, who later became famous as the long-time head coach at Clemson.

"The 2009–10 season was the 115th season in the history of Plymouth Argyle Football Club, their 85th in the Football League, and 41st in the second tier of the English football league system. Their 21st-place finish in the 2008–09 season meant it was their sixth successive season playing in the Championship. Their campaign ended disappointingly as they were relegated to League One with 11 wins, 8 draws, and 27 losses from 46 matches. The club exited both domestic cup competitions at the first stage, being eliminated by Newcastle United in the third round of the FA Cup and by Gillingham in the first round of the League Cup. The club changed managers in December due to a string of poor results as Paul Sturrock was replaced by Paul Mariner. The club began their league campaign with two draws, but defeat by Cardiff City marked the beginning of a seven-game losing streak. Results improved in October and November before three more successive defeats saw Sturrock replaced by Mariner. Performances gradually improved and the club won both of their fixtures during the Christmas period, including a 4–1 win against Reading; their best of the season. The club signed Damien Johnson in the winter transfer window from Birmingham City and made a number of signings on loan, including Kenny Cooper and David Stockdale, in order to try to improve their league position. A succession of draws and narrow defeats followed in February, which prompted Mariner to make more signings. Argyle lost three of their next nine matches to give themselves a chance of avoiding relegation, but their win at Doncaster Rovers proved to be the last game that they would collect any points in. Defeats at home to Middlesbrough and away to Watford left the club on the brink of a return to England's third tier, and that was confirmed in their next game. Newcastle United won 2–0 at Home Park to secure the Championship title, and relegated the home side at the same time.

"The 2010 Turkish Grand Prix (formally the 2010 Formula 1 Turkish Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 30 May 2010 at the Istanbul Park circuit near Istanbul, Turkey. It was the seventh round of the 2010 Formula One season and the sixth Turkish Grand Prix. The 58-lap race was won by McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton who started from second position. His teammate Jenson Button finished second, and Red Bull driver Mark Webber came in third. Webber clinched the pole position and maintained his lead at the start of the race with Hamilton in second who fended off a challenge from Sebastian Vettel in the other Red Bull. The order was maintained until the first round of pit stops when Hamilton lost second place after his crew had trouble with fitting one of his tyres correctly. Webber conserved fuel on lap 40 which allowed Vettel to challenge him for the lead but the two collided which led to the latter retiring from the event and the incident promoted Hamilton and Button into the first and second positions. Hamilton and Button were instructed to conserve fuel for the remainder of the race but the latter had not been giving a target lap time and attempted to overtake Hamilton on lap 48 although the former retained the lead which he held for the remaining ten laps to win his first race of the season. Hamilton's victory made him the fifth different driver in seven races to win a Grand Prix in 2010. The result meant Webber's advantage over second place in the Drivers' Championship, now occupied by Button, was extended by five points. Hamilton's victory meant he moved into third place, while Alonso went from third to fourth. Vettel's retirement resulted in him dropping from second to fifth. McLaren's one-two finish resulted in them reducing Red Bull's lead in the Constructors' Championship to one point.

"The 2007 AFC Asian Cup Final was a football match that took place on 29 July 2007 at the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta, Indonesia, to determine the 2007 AFC Asian Cup champion. Iraq defeated Saudi Arabia 1–0 with a header from Younis Mahmoud from Hawar Mulla Mohammed's corner in the 73rd minute sealing the victory. Before the match, Iraq had never reached the final of the Asian Cup, let alone won the tournament, while Saudi Arabia had appeared in five of the last six Asian Cup finals, winning three of them (1984, 1988 and 1996) and finishing as runners-up in the other two (1992 and 2000). This final was only the second all-Arab final in Asian Cup history, with the other being the 1996 edition. Iraq entered the game as underdogs; the team only won two of their eight pre-tournament friendlies and both wins were against teams that did not qualify for the tournament. Their manager, Jorvan Vieira had only been in charge of the team for two months while the team were forced to train outside of their home country due to the lack of safety in their homeland; they also suffered from poor facilities as they did not have enough kits to last the tournament and had to order a new set of kits with a different design on midway through the tournament, and they struggled to travel to the different matches due to passport and financial problems. In fact, the war-torn nation almost pulled out of the game after two bomb attacks targeting jubilant football fans who were celebrating the semi-final win over South Korea killed at least 50 people and injured 135 but they decided to play on to honour the dead. Most pundits believed that if Iraq managed to pip Oman to second place in their group, they would be knocked out at the quarter-finals, but Iraq ended up finishing top of their group and then winning the whole tournament. The result saw thousands of Iraqis spilling onto the streets to celebrate the victory, and the win temporarily united the fractured nation, as Sunnis, Shias and Kurds celebrated with each other despite their opposing beliefs, a reflection of the team itself that consisted of players from all three groups. Iraq's victory in the tournament is seen as one of the greatest giant-killings in international football history and one of the sport's greatest fairytale victories, and commentator Simon Hill described the team as \""a team without hope, bringing joy to its fractured nation\"" and \""succeeding where the politicians were failing\"". The win saw Iraq qualify for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa. The tournament's closing ceremony was held immediately prior to kickoff.",sports,8

The final was contested by Dunloy of Antrim and Birr of Offaly, with Birr winning by 1-19 to 0-11. The All-Ireland final was the fourth championship meeting between Birr and Dunloy. The Offalymen were hoping to make history by winning a record-breaking fourth All-Ireland title, while Dunloy were hoping to claim their first All-Ireland title in their third appearance in a final. In a game that never ignited, Declan Pilkington gave Birr a lead after two minutes just by latching onto a long Brian Whelahan free and turning it over the bar. The Dunloy defence was working hard, however, Pilkington, Simon Whelahan, Paul Molloy and the Hanniffy brothers Rory and Gary all struck for points. In the 24th minute Dunloy's Nigel Elliott made a great catch before offloading to his brother Ally who found himself in open space less than 20 metres out. The referee Sean McMahon blew for a free and play was called back for a foul on Nigel Elliott. A pointed free resulted as Dunloy were denied an almost certain goal. Before the break, Birr tacked on three more points, all from the hurley of Simon Whelehan, to take a reasonable five-point lead at the interval. Dunloy set about reducing the deficit after the restart with two drilled frees from Gregory O'Kane bringing them within three, however, that was as close as Dunloy got. Birr gradually imposed their will on the game and the points came more readily. Simon Whelehan had four from frees, Declan Pilkington, Molloy, the two Hanniffys again and impressive sub Stephen Browne with a brace crushed the effort of Dunloy. In the 56th minute Birr were leading by 0-17 to 0-10 when they pounced for a goal. A long Brian Whelahan free hopped off Dunloy 'keeper Gareth McGhee's hand onto the crossbar and rebounded before an alert Declan Pilkington sent it to the net to kill the game. Birr's All-Ireland victory was their second in succession, thus becoming the third team ever to retain the title. The win gave them their fourth All-Ireland title over all and put them as outright leaders on the all-time roll of honour.",sports,8

"Associazione Sportiva Roma endured possibly its most troubled season ever, in which the club almost went from a genuine title threat to relegation. Despite its eight place, the 18th placed Bologna was only a few points behind in the close table. The problems started before the season began, with coach Fabio Capello signing for Juventus, and key players Emerson and Walter Samuel departing. That Samuel departed to Real Madrid was greeted with disappointment, but the move was thought to be necessary given the financial struggles of Roma. The moves for Capello and Emerson in contrast, were controversial, with Rome's mayor Walter Veltroni even having to step in to calm feelings down, when Capello had decided to buy Emerson to the Turin club. Controversy resumed when Roma signed French defender Philippe Mexès from Auxerre, despite a rolling contract. Auxerre took Roma to UEFA court, and in July 2005, Roma was suspended from the transfer market for a full calendar year. In the midst of chaos, new coach Cesare Prandelli decided to resign when finding out his wife was seriously ill (she would survive another two years before dying), and Prandelli returned to football with Fiorentina one year later. Rudi Völler, formerly a striker at the club, and the man in charge when Germany reached the final of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, took over, but the German did not last long, complaining of a lack of organisation. Former Chievo coach Luigi Delneri, who had been sacked from European champions Porto in pre-season, due to spending too much time in his native Italy, took charge, but the squad lacked confidence, and the scandals and internal fighting caused Roma to slip into the relegation fight. Former club midfielder Bruno Conti saved the club from relegation, owing much to striking duo Vincenzo Montella and Francesco Totti. A notable incident during the season was referee Anders Frisk being hit by a coin in a Champions League fixture against Dynamo Kyiv, as Roma crashed out of the tournament in its initial phase. Another intrigue was the tug of war between captain Francesco Totti and young pretender Antonio Cassano, a battle Cassano lost.

It was the final match of the 1966–67 Football League Cup, the seventh season of the Football League Cup, a football competition for the teams in The Football League. This was the first final to be decided over a single game; the six previous finals were contested over two legs. QPR were appearing in their first final, while Albion were appearing in their second after winning the previous final in 1966. As QPR were in the Third Division they played one more round than Albion who received a bye in the first round. Therefore, QPR progressed through six rounds to reach the final, whereas Albion progressed through five. Matches up to the semi-final were contested on a one-off basis with the exception of the semi-finals which were contested over two-legs, with a match at each team's home ground. QPR's matches were generally close affairs, they only won by a three two goal margin or more in three of their matches. Albion's matches were almost all comfortable victories. Their biggest margin of victory was five goals when they beat Aston Villa 6–1. While the only match did not win was the second leg of the semi-final against West Ham United, which was drawn 2–2.

It received this name because of the stunning defeat of Real Madrid, one of the biggest teams in Spanish football, by AD Alcorcón, a modest team which then played in the third-tier Segunda División B. This defeat was a lead sports story throughout Europe, being the title page in British, French and Italian publications. It also marked a rise to relative prominence for the suburban Madrid club; in what may or may not have been a coincidence, Alcorcón began a major stadium renovation project the following month. The half-time substitution of Guti when the score was 3–0 and when he was booked before was another topic in the Spanish press because of words exchanged between the player and his coach, Manuel Pellegrini. It generated superstition and the number of the 4–0 day, 27 October 2009, (27,109) was one of the best-selling lottery tickets on Christmas 2009.

"The 1988 Football League Cup Final (also known as the Littlewoods Challenge Cup Final for sponsorship reasons) was an association football match between Luton Town and Arsenal on 24 April 1988 at Wembley Stadium, London. It was the final match of the 1987–88 staging of the Football League Cup. Luton were making their first League Cup Final appearance, while the competition holders Arsenal were appearing in their fourth final. Each club needed to get past five rounds to reach the showpiece event at Wembley. Both clubs made comfortable progress; Luton scored 14 goals and conceded three, Arsenal on the other hand conceded two fewer. Luton for the final were without Darron McDonough who injured himself in training, but David Preece and Ricky Hill both returned to the side after lengthy periods of treatment. Goalkeeper Les Sealey was not fit in time to play, so Andy Dibble deputised in goal for only his sixth appearance of the season. Gus Caesar replaced David O'Leary in Arsenal's starting eleven, as the Irishman was ruled out for the final having damaged his achilles weeks prior. Arsenal entered the match as favourites, but went behind early when Brian Stein scored. Luton's disciplined approach, coupled with a strong performance by Dibble, contained Arsenal to few chances throughout the game. The holders equalised and took the lead in quick succession through Martin Hayes and Alan Smith, but failed to seal the win when Nigel Winterburn missed a penalty. A revitalised Luton staged a late comeback; Caesar's failed clearance led to Danny Wilson equalising, and in the 90th minute, Brian Stein scored the winner after poor defending from Arsenal. The 1988 final was Luton's first major cup victory; their manager Ray Harford later described it as the greatest win in his time at the club. Luton did not qualify for European football the following season, despite winning the League Cup as UEFA chose not to relax its ban on English teams. Arsenal manager George Graham in the meantime strengthened his squad as a result of his team's poor defensive display. Caesar found his playing time limited in subsequent seasons, as the manager brought in Steve Bould.

"Keep Your Head Down is the fifth Korean studio album (ninth overall) by South Korean pop duo TVXQ, released on January 5, 2011 by S.M. Entertainment.

Bringing in a new line of producers, including E-Tribe and Outsidaz, Keep Your Head Down largely consists of dance-pop songs with urban and electronic arrangements. The album has been described by critics as fierce, dark, and powerful due to its SMP influence, an experimental genre that is defined by mixing the styles of orchestral pop, rock, and contemporary R&B with hip hop beats to create catchy, rhythmic tracks that allow for very strong dance performances. Released in two different versions, the album spawned two promotional singles with one lead single, \""Keep Your Head Down\"". Lyrically, the album explores dark themes of relationships, betrayal and self-empowerment. In South Korea, the album debuted at number one on the Gaon Albums Chart for the week of January 8, 2011, and maintained its number-one position for a second week.

"Melicious is the debut and only solo album by singer Melissa Lefton. On many promotional copies it was simply titled \""Melissa Lefton\"". The album was originally stated to be due for release on August 21, 2001 on Jive Records. It was later said to be due for release in Spring 2002, but was eventually suspended indefinitely. The album was produced by The Matrix. The only copies of the album that exist are full length promotional copies, none of which include the publicized album cover. There are two variations: one is an acetate promo which has a stick-on label and comes in an orange jewel case. The other comes in a cardboard sleeve and features Lefton in a T-shirt with a jolly roger on it. A three song sampler also exists which plays the songs \""My Hit Song,\"" \""Ozone\"" and \""Sugar Daddy\"". Melicious took on topics like pollution, sugar daddies, occultism and murder, with tongue in cheek lyrics. The month before it was due for release, the Seattle Weekly gave a favourable review of the album, as did the Autumn 2001 edition of Elle Girl. MacKenzie Wilson from AllMusic also spoke highly of the album, saying it \""matches the pop sassiness of the Go-Go's and Cyndi Lauper\"". Jimmy Draper from AllMusic gave the album four stars out of five, concluding \""This isn't your typical Top 40 fodder because, thankfully, there isn't anything typical about Lefton's surprisingly enjoyable and energetic debut.\"" Five years after it was cancelled, Stylus Magazine gave the album a positive review and referred to Lefton as \""[T]he queen of shelved teenpop\"".

The track \""Radio Rainbow\"" appears in the film Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge, though the film did not release an accompanying soundtrack. A promotional short film was created to promote the album. Called Behind the Muse, it was a mockumentary spoofing the Behind the Music program and format.

After a nearly fatal car crash she records a critically panned album titled \""Ouch!\"", and then revitalizes her career as a Las Vegas lounge singer. The humor in the film is decidedly not for young people; for example, regarding her addiction, Lefton states: \""I was making love to sweaty bums just to score a hit of SunnyD, and it didn't feel good on my vagina.\"" The film was promotionally distributed on VHS and MiniDV tapes.",music,6

Allen's inspiration was a trip to Kaifeng Fu (prefecture), China, the site of a major Jewish migration in the 10th century (see Kaifeng Jews).

Chu Chem is a scholar who, with his wife Rose and daughter Lotte, journeys to Kaifeng Fu to learn about his ancestors and find a husband for the young woman. Prince Eagle suggests she become one of his concubines, a proposal she finds distasteful. Eventually he abdicates his throne for the woman he loves, and Chu Chem discovers the Jews became so assimilated into their new homeland that no traces of them are to be found. The production's designs attempted to imitate traditional Chinese theatre, ironically with sumo wrestlers (one the son of Man Mountain Dean) grappling onstage during intermission to entertain the audience. Director Albert Marre cast Yiddish theatre stars Menasha Skulnik and Molly Picon as Chu Chem and Rose, Marcia Rodd as Lotte, and James Shigeta as Prince Eagle. Choreographer Jack Cole also took on the role of Mongol Lord Hoo Hah. During rehearsals Picon, upset that her role had been reduced, walked out, but eventually returned. The November 1966 tryout at the New Locust Theatre in Philadelphia was plagued by constant revisions to the script and score, and an unhappy Picon quit permanently. At one point on opening night, her successor Henrietta Jacobson turned to the audience and announced, \""There was a song here, but you'll be better off without it.\"" The reviews were brutal, with one critic describing it \""like blintzes and soy sauce\"" and suggesting \""a better title might be The King and Oy.\"" Co-producers Leigh and Cheryl Crawford immediately cancelled the scheduled Broadway opening at the George Abbott Theatre. Unwilling to leave well enough alone, Allen and Leigh decided to revive the show twenty-two years later at the Jewish Repertory Theatre in Manhattan. The greatly revamped version eliminated the play-within-a-play concept and the role of Rose, placed greater emphasis on the romance between Lotte and the prince, and revised the score. Encouraged by a favorable review  from the third-string New York Times critic, the creative team decided to move it uptown. The Broadway production, directed and choreographed by Albert Marre, opened on March 17, 1989 at the Ritz Theatre where, hampered by a no-name cast (Emily Zacharias as Lotte, Mark Zeller as Chu Chem, and Thom Sesma as the prince) and poor-to-dreadful reviews, it ran for only 68 performances, continuing for two months at heavy losses in the hope it would garner some Tony Award nominations in a season beset by bad musicals (Carrie, Legs Diamond). When it was shut out, the production closed, a two-time flop in musical theatre history.",music,6

"\""Twilight Time\"" is a popular song with lyrics by Buck Ram, and the music by The Three Suns (Morty Nevins, Al Nevins, and Artie Dunn). Ram said that he originally wrote it as a poem, without music, while in college. Original instrumental recordings of \""Twilight Time\"" included those made respectively by the Three Suns (1944) and Les Brown & His Band of Renown (1945). Les Brown's version of \""Twilight Time\"" was recorded in November 1944 and released in early 1945 as the B-side of \""Sentimental Journey,\"" the first recording of that song. While the A-side featured Doris Day's vocals, \""Twilight Time\"" was an instrumental. The first vocal version of the song on record was released, also in 1945, by bandleader Jimmy Dorsey with Teddy Walters on vocals. It has been recorded by numerous groups over the years. However, the best-known version of the song was recorded by the Platters and became a number one hit on both the pop singles and R&B Best Sellers charts in 1958 in the United States. The song also reached number three in the United Kingdom. In 1963, the Platters recorded a Spanish version of the song entitled \""La Hora del Crepúsculo\"", sung in a rhumba-style tempo.",music,6

"\""Vivo cantando\"" (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈbiβo kanˈtando], \""I Live Singing\"") was one of four songs which tied for first place in the Eurovision Song Contest 1969. Performed in Spanish by Salomé for Spain, the song was joint winner with the United Kingdom's \""Boom Bang-a-Bang\"" performed by Lulu, \""De troubadour\"" by Lenny Kuhr representing the Netherlands, and \""Un jour, un enfant\"" sung for France by Frida Boccara. It was Spain's second winning entry in the contest and the last to date. The song is a very up-tempo number, sung from the perspective of a woman telling her lover about the positive changes he has had on her, specifically that she now lives her life singing. Two memorable aspects of the performance were Salomé's costume – a Pertegaz pantsuit covered in long strands of porcelain resembling beads – and the fact that the singer chose to dance on the spot during certain parts of the song. Dancing was against Eurovision Song Contest regulations at the time; Salomé was not penalized, however, as the performers from Ireland and the United Kingdom had done the same that year as well. Salomé recorded the song in six languages; Spanish (Castellano), Catalan (as \""Canto i vull viure\""), Basque (\""Kantari bizi naiz\""), English (\""The Feeling of Love\""), French (\""Alors je chante\"") and Italian (\""Vivo cantando\""). It was succeeded as Spanish representative at the 1970 Contest by Julio Iglesias with \""Gwendolyne\"".",music,6

At the close of voting, it had received 68 points, placing it 8th in a field of 18.

Judy, or someone else just like her, may very well be the girl you end up marrying - but also the one \""you would sacrifice for a handful of snow\"". After participating in the ESC Rapsat would go on to become one of Belgium's most successful and celebrated singer-songwriters of all time, often referred to as a \""modern day Jaques Brel\"", known for his narrative and poetic lyrics, musically combining influences from French chanson with rock, blues and reggae and in his later career also with rhythms from the Middle East and Africa.

"\""Shake Sherry\"" (sometimes spelled on record as \""Shake Sherrie\"") was a 1962 R&B song by Motown Records group The Contours, issued on its Gordy subsidiary label (Gordy 7012). It was the follow-up to the group's million-selling top-5 hit single \""Do You Love Me\"", and was taken from their album of the same name. Not as successful as its predecessor, \""Shake Sherry\"" missed the Billboard Pop Top 40, peaking at number 43, and charted at number 21 on its R&B Chart. It was written by Motown Records' founder and first President Berry Gordy, who had written the group's previous hit, and had been quite successful as a songwriter and producer before founding Motown Records, having written hit singles for Jackie Wilson, Etta James, Marv Johnson, and others. Unlike \""Do You Love Me\"", which had been (allegedly) originally intended for The Temptations, Shake Sherry was written specifically for The Contours, one of several songs Gordy composed for the group. This song's relative chart failure, compared to \""Do You Love Me\"", meant that The Contours' run as a headline act in the Motortown Revue touring shows of the early 1960s was relatively short-lived: although their live performances made them a crowd favorite, history has branded them as \""one hit wonders\"". Despite Motown's relative lack of promotion, The Contours charted several times for the label between 1962 and 1967.",music,6
"Stand Your Ground is the second album by the band Little Barrie. The album is produced by Dan the Automator and Mike \""Prince Fatty\"" Pelanconi. The band went for a more straight rock’n’roll sound in their own words as a result of touring the first record ... we wanted more something more rock’n’roll to play on stage. And it’s partly because while we were touring we were getting back into stuff we hadn’t listened to for a while, like old garage stuff, and The Cramps. We thought it might be a bit more of a stripped-down, southern fried soul sort of thing. We expected it would maybe almost have a Lee Dorsey, Tony Joe White influence. But then we started getting into different things – started toughening the beats up, and getting into mad '50s reverb on the guitars. I became interested in the energy of those sounds, but still keeping the soulful thing in it. It sort of went a bit darker. We wanted this record to be less psychedelic than the last one, and there's less guitars on it. They choose to work with The Automator because of what he'd done with the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. And also the thought of working with someone who wasn't a conventional rock producer. We thought he might come up with something a bit less conventional. And also cos the record was sort of inspired by soul and funk and maybe some dance music even. Drumming on the record are new band recruit Billy Skinner and the Blues Explosion's Russell Simins.Hubert Sumlin joined the band in the studio, though he didn't appear in the final recording. Some songs in Cadogan's words: Just Wanna Play is dedicated to some friends of mine who got burned by a record label, Bailing Out was just a string of thoughts I wrote while we were on tour with DJ Format – 23 dates in 24 days: I'd forgotten about it, then played it in rehearsals, and this kind of bastardised Bo Diddley thing came out. Yeah We Know is just a string of thoughts on things I saw leaning out of a window where I used to live, the Marquis Estate in Islington, which was pretty notorious but we never had any problems. Green Eyed Fool is about a bit of jealousy and cynicism you get from people who haven't had the balls to do things for themselves.",music,6

"The King and I is a musical, the fifth by the team of composer Richard Rodgers and dramatist Oscar Hammerstein II. It is based on the 1944 novel Anna and the King of Siam by Margaret Landon, which is in turn derived from the memoirs of Anna Leonowens, governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s. The musical's plot relates the experiences of Anna, a British schoolteacher hired as part of the King's drive to modernize his country. The relationship between the King and Anna is marked by conflict through much of the piece, as well as by a love that neither can admit. The musical premiered on March 29, 1951, at Broadway's St. James Theatre. It ran nearly three years, then the fourth longest-running Broadway musical in history, and has had many tours and revivals. In 1950, theatrical attorney Fanny Holtzmann was looking for a part for her client, veteran leading lady Gertrude Lawrence. Holtzmann realized that Landon's book would provide an ideal vehicle and contacted Rodgers and Hammerstein, who were initially reluctant but agreed to write the musical. The pair initially sought Rex Harrison to play the supporting part of the King, a role that he had played in the 1946 film made from Landon's book, but he was unavailable. They settled on the young actor and television director Yul Brynner. The musical was an immediate hit, winning Tony Awards for Best Musical, Best Actress (for Lawrence) and Best Featured Actor (for Brynner). Lawrence died unexpectedly of cancer a year and a half after the opening, and the role of Anna was played by several actresses during the remainder of the Broadway run of 1,246 performances. A hit London run and U.S. national tour followed, together with a 1956 film for which Brynner won an Academy Award, and the musical was recorded several times. In later revivals, Brynner came to dominate his role and the musical, starring in a four-year national tour culminating in a 1985 Broadway run shortly before his death. Christopher Renshaw directed major revivals on Broadway (1996), winning the Tony Award for Best Revival, and in the West End (2000). A 2015 Broadway revival won another Tony for Best Revival. Both professional and amateur revivals of The King and I continue to be staged regularly throughout the English-speaking world.",music,6

Since then, it has been recorded by many other artists, including US country music band the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, whose version (recorded for the 1970 album Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy) was issued as a single and rose to number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart in 1971. Live versions of the song appeared on Walker's 1977 album, A Man Must Carry On and his 1980 album The Best of Jerry Jeff Walker. The NGDB's single version begins with the Uncle Charlie interview (subtitled \""Prologue: Uncle Charlie and his Dog Teddy\"") that also precedes the song on the Uncle Charlie album.

Melsen was the first native Luxembourgian to represent the Grand Duchy since Camillo Felgen in the 1960 and 1962 Contests. The song is an up-tempo number dealing - as the title suggests - with Melsen eating an apple. Doing so reminds her that it is Spring, which causes her to wonder if she will find love during that season, or whether she will only find \""the snake\"". She appears not to mind overmuch, singing that she is \""not even twenty yet\"". Melsen also recorded the song in German (as \""Komm, komm, komm\""), English (\""The Love Beat\"") and Italian (\""Pom, pom, pom\"").

This was UFO's last concert recording with guitarist Michael Schenker before the band's reunion in 1993. Schenker left the band during this tour; this led to the band having to recruit former bandmate & ex-Lone Star guitarist Paul Chapman. It has been rumoured that Schenker refused to record any overdubs for the album, which would make this an accurate account of his live guitar work. When he has discussed the album, Schenker has spoken of disappointment with the chosen tracks, saying \""there were better takes they could've used\"". Strangers in the Night peaked at No. 7 on the UK charts and No. 42 on the US charts. Strangers in the Night is often listed by critics and fans as one of the greatest live rock albums of all time.

Wells' first album release was 1956's Country Hit Parade on Decca Records, which compiled her hits during her first four years of recording for the label. Prior to its release, many labels were reluctant to release albums by female country artists until Wells became the first female vocalist to sell records. Following its release, Wells and her label issued three studio albums during the 1950s: Winner of Your Heart (1957), Lonely Street (1958), and Dust on the Bible (1959).

"Lobet den Herrn, alle seine Heerscharen (Praise ye the Lord, all ye of his great armies), BWV Anh 5, is a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. Consisting of seven movements, it was one of two cantatas which he composed for the twenty-fourth birthday of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen on 10 December 1718. The librettist was Christian Friedrich Hunold (Menantes). The other cantata, Der Himmel dacht auf Anhalts Ruhm und Glück, BWV 66a, can be reconstructed. The music of Lobet den Herrn, alle seine Heerschare is completely lost, but there has been speculation that Bach could have reused it in another work. As a congratulatory work Lobet den Herrn, alle seine Heerschare is classed as a secular cantata rather than a church cantata. However, it is described as being intended for performance in connection with a religious service (bey gehaltenem Gottes-Dienste) and the librettist used text from Psalm 119. This makes the work unusual in the context of Bach's output at Köthen. Normally Bach was not expected to provide music for the religious services at court because of Calvinist antipathy towards elaborate music.",music,6

"\""Too Much\"" was the Latvian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2001, performed in English by Arnis Mednis. The song is an up-tempo number, which features an accordion as one of its instruments. Mednis describes his feelings of cold feet before his impending marriage, feelings which result in him going out on the town the night beforehand. The setting then shifts to \""the day after marriage\"", when the newly married couple are walking through town and opt to have a drink. Unfortunately for Mednis, they happen to see \""girls from last night\"" in the bar they choose. Exactly what these girls did with Mednis before his marriage is never made clear, however the chorus features him pleading with his wife to \""take me back\"", implying that it was something serious. Somewhat amusingly, Mednis' new wife is referred to as \""my caring, lovely fiancée\"" in the second verse, despite the pair being married by this point. For his Eurovision appearance, Mednis wore a black cardigan and trousers, a white shirt, and dark glasses. His backing performers included two women, one in a sleeveless black gown, another in a white blouse and trousers, who provided vocal accompaniment, during the chorus.

"American rapper Angel Haze has released one studio album, one internet album, two extended plays (EPs), four mixtapes and nineteen singles (including four as a featured artist and nine promotional singles). In July 2012, after releasing two prior mixtapes, Haze released a mixtape Reservation online for free. The title is inspired by the act of reserving a table at a restaurant, saying \""[…] For me, it’s like that with the rap industry. I made my reservation there […] and now I’m finally arriving\"". The lead single \""New York\"" peaked at number 58 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 12 on the UK R&B Singles Chart. Shortly after, Haze released a commercial EP compiled of tracks from Reservation, titled New York, followed by a fourth mixtape, Classick. Throughout late 2013, during the run-up to the release of the debut album, Haze released a cover of a popular song every day, for thirty days. Most famous from these freestyles was the adaptation of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis's track \""Same Love\"", which discusses childhood, prejudice, homophobia and sexuality. The series was dubbed 30 Gold. In late 2013, Haze leaked their debut album Dirty Gold after a disagreement with the record label, who wanted to put out the album sometime in early 2014. Due to Haze's leaking of the project, their label quickly released the album, and it was officially distributed to online retailers on December 30, 2013.

"Nordseebilder  (North Sea Pictures) op. 390 is a waltz by Johann Strauss II composed in 1879. This seascape waltz composition resulted from Strauss' visit to the North Frisian island of Föhr, when he and his second wife Angelika stayed in the town of Wyk during one of the holidays. The contrasting moods offered from living so close to the North Sea immediately galvanised Strauss' creative spirit which produced this mature work, capturing the sea storms as well as the strong gale all in 3/4 time. Strauss' audiences in Vienna first heard the work when his brother Eduard Strauss conducted it at one of his concerts in the Musikverein on 16 November 1879. The waltz's slow introduction suggests a calm sea scene, while swirling waves are captured in later themes. The coda incorporates the 'sea storm' scene, with furious chords and fierce brass instruments suggesting the North Sea at the time of a severe gale. The first waltz theme is re-introduced before the work ends in a brilliant finish.",music,6

After much negotiation, Cochran released her from the contract. The premiere production opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London on 26 April 1947, just before Oklahoma! and was directed by Wendy Toye. It was not overshadowed by the American hit, enjoying a good reception from the critics and audiences, and running for three years and a total of 886 performances. The production was notable for its highly stylised scenery by Tanya Moiseiwitsch, a break with the realism of earlier musical comedy sets. One of Webb's songs with Guétary, \""This Is My Lovely Day\"", became one of the BBC's most requested songs of all times, and the song's popularity, and that of the show, were increased by their association with the wedding in 1947 of Princess Elizabeth and Lt. Philip Mountbatten. Only four of the songs were recorded as studio singles by the original cast. A \""disappointing\"" studio recording was made in 1967 with Mary Millar and Roberto Cardinali, and a revival was presented in London in 1987. In 1994, a recording of songs by the original cast was released, produced by David Cunard, as a result of a discovery in the United States of recordings of a radio broadcast.",music,6

"Perry Como was a prolific recording artist for the RCA Victor label between 1943 and 1987, and is credited with numerous gold records. Como had so many recordings achieve gold-record status that he refused to have many of them certified. It was this characteristic which made him so different from his peers, and which endeared him to legions of fans throughout the world. Over the decades, Como is reported to have sold millions of records, but he commonly suppressed these figures. Como was also well known for his recordings and performances of religious music of Christian and Jewish faiths. His first religious recordings, \""Ave Maria\"" and \""The Lord's Prayer\"", were recorded in 1949 in a church, with Como asking his parish priest to sit in on the recording sessions, to make certain they were done in the proper reverential tone. While his performances of \""Ave Maria\"" became traditional on his holiday shows, Como would not perform it for live appearances, despite the requests of his audiences, saying, \""It's not the time or place to do it.\""  In 1953, Perry Como recorded \""Eli, Eli\"" and \""Kol Nidrei\"", and performed the latter on his television shows each year at the appropriate time on the Jewish calendar. His pronunciation and phrasing in both Hebrew and Yiddish were learned from a member of the Mitchell Ayres Orchestra, who was the son of a rabbi. Perry Como received five Emmys from 1955–1959, a Christopher Award (1956) and shared a Peabody Award with good friend Jackie Gleason in 1956. He was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame in 1990 and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 1987.

"\""Footsee\"", credited to Wigan's Chosen Few, was a British hit single in 1975, reaching # 9 on the UK Singles Chart. It is notable as being one of the first commercially successful remixes of a previously released recording. By late 1974, the Northern soul music and dance scene centered on the Wigan Casino club in Lancashire, England, was attracting increasing attention from mainstream media in the UK, at the same time as original American R&B recordings which met the musical criteria of its fans, and which were new to listeners, were becoming more difficult to find. According to most sources, Dave McAleer, then working for Pye Records' Disco Demand subsidiary label, heard a 1968 single by the obscure Canadian band, The Chosen Few. The record's B-side was a brief instrumental version of the A-side. It had originally been released on the Transworld record label in Canada, and was reissued in the US by Roulette Records (Roulette 7015) as a tie-in with the popular \""Footsee\"" toy. Pye held the rights to the Roulette catalogue in the UK, and McAleer arranged for the original instrumental track to be speeded up in the recording studio to the right dance tempo. It was also overdubbed with car horns and crowd noises, which are variously reported to be taken from the 1966 FA Cup final between Everton and Sheffield Wednesday, or alternatively a group of revellers invited into the Pye studio. Released on the Disco Demand label in late 1974, the remixed and overdubbed record reached the UK chart in January 1975. The B-side was a true Northern soul favourite, \""Seven Days Too Long\"" by Chuck Wood. When \""Footsee\"" was featured on BBC Television's Top of the Pops, dancers from the Wigan Casino gave a demonstration of the Northern Soul style of dancing, in the absence of a real group to promote the record. Music journalist, Stuart Maconie, described the record as an \""embarrassing novelty\"" and \""execrable\"" in his autobiography, Cider With Roadies.",music,6

"\""Hoots Mon\"" is a song written by Harry Robinson, and performed by Lord Rockingham's XI. It was a number-one hit single for three weeks in 1958 on the UK Singles Chart. It is based on the old Scottish folk song \""A Hundred Pipers\"". It was also one of the first rock and roll songs to feature the Hammond organ, which would become popular in rock and roll music the following year with Dave Cortez's \""The Happy Organ\"". The record is mostly instrumental, punctuated by four stereotypical Scottish phrases: \n* \""Och aye\"", an exclamation meaning \""Yes\"" \n* \""Hoots mon\"", an interjection usually meaning \""Hey man!\"" \n* \""There's a moose loose aboot this hoose\"" (\""There's a mouse loose about this house\""), a standard cliché highlighting Scots language pronunciation. \n* \""It's a braw, bricht, moonlicht nicht.\"" (\""It's a fine, bright moonlit night\"") The author and journalist Benny Green played the tenor saxophone on the recording. The song was revived by Bad Manners. It was also used in a commercial for Maynards Wine Gums with the line \""There's a moose loose aboot this hoose\"" changed to \""There's juice loose aboot this hoose\"".",music,6
"\""Gimme\"" was the Cypriot entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2002 by the boy band One, performed in English and is the first occasion that the Cypriot entry did not featured Greek lyrics. The song is a boyband number, with a girl being asked to give a sign that she loves the singers. The song was performed first on the night, followed by the United Kingdom's Jessica Garlick with \""Come Back\"". At the close of voting, it had received 85 points, placing 6th in a field of 24. A few seconds after the lead singer Constantinos Christoforou began singing, a technical hitch led to a caption bearing the words 'Ugly Duckling' on the background video screen. Fortunately the picture of the stage was quickly brought back. One of the members of the band, Constantinos Christoforou, had already participated for Cyprus at the Eurovision Song Contest 1996 with the song \""Mono Yia Mas\"". He would later make a further solo appearance at the 2005 Contest with \""Ela Ela (Come Baby)\"" after the band formally disbanded. Therefore, the song represents the middle leg in a rare sequence of a Eurovision contestant performing solo, then as a member of a vocal group, before a second solo performance.",music,6

"All the News That's Fit to Sing was Phil Ochs' first official album. Recorded in 1964 for Elektra Records, it was full of many elements that would come back throughout his career. It was the album that defined his \""singing journalist\"" phase, strewn with songs whose roots were allegedly pulled from Newsweek magazine. It is one in a long line of folk albums used to tell stories about everyday struggles and hardships. Among these stories was that of William Worthy, an American journalist who traveled to Cuba in spite of an embargo on the country who was forbidden to return to the United States. Civil rights figures Medgar Evers and Emmett Till were lionized in \""Too Many Martyrs\"" (alternatively known as \""The Ballad of Medgar Evers\"".) Two \""talking blues\"" using the melody to the old folk song \""John Hardy\"" jabbed sarcastic at Vietnam and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Even a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, \""The Bells\"", was set to music. \""The Thresher\"" was an ode to the sinking of the nuclear-powered American submarine, the USS Thresher: \""And she'll always run silent/And she'll always run deep.\"" Also included was one of Ochs' most well-known songs, \""Power and the Glory\"". The title references the motto of The New York Times, \""All the news that's fit to print.\"" The Times was founded by Adolph Ochs (no relation to Phil), so this may be a joke or allusion to the coincidence.",music,6
"Closer Than Ever is a musical revue in two acts, with words by Richard Maltby, Jr. and music by David Shire. The revue contains no dialogue, and Maltby and Shire have described this show as a \""bookless book musical\"". The show was originally conceived by Steven Scott Smith as a one act revue entitled \""Next Time Now!\"", which was first given at the nightclub Eighty-Eights. The success of \""Next Time Now!\"" led to a much expanded production retitled Closer Than Ever that was co-directed by Maltby and Smith. This production began its life at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts during the Summer of 1989. It came to New York the following Fall, opening in previews on 17 October 1989, and officially opening on 6 November 1989 at the off-Broadway Cherry Lane Theatre, where it ran for 312 performances. The cast included Brent Barrett, Sally Mayes, Richard Muenz, and Lynne Wintersteller. Closer Than Ever features self-contained songs which deal with such diverse topics as security, aging, mid-life crisis, second marriages, working couples, and unrequited love. Maltby and Shire based many of the songs on real-life experiences of their friends, or stories told to them. The revue won the Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Off-Broadway Musical and Maltby, Shire, and Wintersteller all garnered Drama Desk Award nominations for their respective contributions. The original New York cast recorded an album of the revue for RCA Victor (RCA Victor 60399).",music,6

"The Light in the Piazza is a musical with a book by Craig Lucas and music and lyrics by Adam Guettel. Based on a novella by Elizabeth Spencer, the story is set in the 1950s and revolves around Margaret Johnson, a wealthy Southern woman and her developmentally stalled daughter, Clara, who spend a summer together in Italy. When Clara falls in love with a young Italian man, Margaret is forced to reconsider not only Clara's future, but her own deep seated hopes and regrets as well. The score breaks from the 21st century tradition of pop music on Broadway by moving into the territory of Neoromantic classical music and opera, with unexpected harmonic shifts and extended melodic structures, and is more heavily orchestrated than most Broadway scores. Many of the lyrics are in Italian or broken English, as many of the characters are fluent only in Italian.",music,6

"\""They Don't Care About Us\"" is the fourth single from Michael Jackson's album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I, released on March 31, 1996. The song remains one of the most controversial pieces Jackson ever composed. In the US, media scrutiny surrounding allegations of antisemitic lyrics were the catalyst for Jackson issuing multiple apologies and re-recording the song with altered lyrics. The singer countered allegations of antisemitism, arguing that reviews had misinterpreted the context of the song, either unintentionally or deliberately. The song was also covered by Christian alternative metal band P.O.D. in 1998 as a bonus track on the special edition version of their album, The Fundamental Elements of Southtown. The album contains an uncensored version of the song. Christian stores removed the album when the special edition came out because of the controversial lyrics including \""Jew me\"" and \""Kike me.\"" The song was accompanied by two music videos directed by Spike Lee. The first was shot in two locations in Brazil, in Pelourinho, the historic city centre of Salvador, and in a favela of Rio de Janeiro called Dona Marta, where the state authorities had tried to ban all production over fears the video would damage their image, the area and prospects of Rio de Janeiro staging the 2004 Olympics. Still, the residents of the area were happy to see the singer, hoping their problems would be made visible to a wider audience. The second video was shot in a prison and contained video footage of multiple references to human rights abuses. Commercially, the song became a top ten hit in all European countries and number one in Germany for three weeks. In the US, radio stations were reluctant to play the controversial composition; it, however, managed to peak at number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was remixed with parts of songs such as \""Privacy\"" (from the album Invincible) and \""Tabloid Junkie\"", and released on the Immortal album, in November, 2011.

On 4 March 2006, Sampson had won the BBC show Making Your Mind Up with the song \""Teenage Life\"", which was written and produced with John Matthews (aka Ricardo Autobahn) from the Cuban Boys, who were responsible for the Hampster Dance hit \""Cognoscenti Vs.

"Leonard Cohen is a Canadian singer-songwriter and poet active in music since 1967. Cohen has released 13 studio albums and 6 live albums during the course of a recording career lasting almost 50 years, throughout which he has remained an active poet. His entire catalogue is available on Columbia Records. His 1967 debut Songs of Leonard Cohen earned an RIAA gold record; he followed up with three more highly acclaimed albums: Songs From A Room (1969), Songs of Love and Hate (1971) and New Skin For The Old Ceremony (1974), before allowing Phil Spector to produce Death of a Ladies' Man for Warner Bros. Records in 1977. Cohen returned to Columbia in 1979 for Recent Songs, but the label declined to release his next album, Various Positions (1984) in the US, leaving it to American shops to import it from CBS Canada. In 1988, Columbia got behind Cohen again and gave full support to I'm Your Man, which brought his career to new heights, and Cohen followed it with 1992's The Future. Cohen then took a nine-year hiatus, and returned with Ten New Songs in (2001), which he made with Sharon Robinson, following this with Dear Heather (2004). In 2008 Cohen began touring for the first time in 15 years and, as well as the release of several live albums, he released Old Ideas (2012) which peaked at #3 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart. This was the highest ranking ever for a Leonard Cohen album, and became his first to top the Canadian Albums Chart, a feat he repeated with his followup, Popular Problems, released in 2014.

"\""Wir sind wir (ein Deutschlandlied)\"" (\""We Are We\"" (i.e. \""We are who we are\""), a Germany song) was released as a stand-alone single by Paul van Dyk in 2004. Unlike most of his other singles, this was not released on any official studio album by van Dyk. The song features Peter Heppner on vocals, and was only recorded in German, presumably because it speaks directly to Germans and Germany. Are we the land of poets and thinkers, the land of the Wirtschaftswunder [economic wonder], the land of two world wars, the land which was divided and thereafter reunited? \""Wir sind wir\"" deals with the deep feeling of emotional insecurity that permeates the German society in the early 21st century. In 2004, Germany was in an economic slump, the controversial Hartz IV law had diminished the state welfare programs, and there was a lingering feeling of division between the one-time West German and East German provinces. The fact that Germany had turned itself from a one-time pariah into a valuable friend of the Western great powers (Britain, France, the United States) and had reunited itself with the end of the Cold War were suddenly unimportant. There was little pride in being German, and patriotism was a suppressed emotion. This is reflected in the lyrics: despite having turned \""ash into gold\"", people were feeling angst and fear of the future (40 Jahre zogen wir an einem Strang, aus Asche haben wir Gold gemacht/ (...) was vorher war ist heute nichts mehr wert). Heppner and Van Dyk then ask, where do the Germans stand, and answer \""we are we, we are one, this is just a bad period, and we won't give up\"" (wir sind wir/ wieder eins in einem Land/ das ist doch nur ein schlechter Lauf/ so schnell geben wir doch jetzt nicht auf). The song is a powerful statement for all Germans that they are neither bad nor good, but just themselves (we are we). For 40 years, everything went well, and now after some bad years, it is time to stand united and face the future together. The lyrics highlight the positive qualities of German culture and society and stand as a beacon of hope.",music,6

"Ramones is the debut studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones, released on April 23, 1976 by Sire Records. After Hit Parader editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, she wrote about them in an article and contacted Danny Fields, insisting he be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced Craig Leon to produce Ramones, and the band recorded a demo for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president Seymour Stein to listen to the band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques to those of the Beatles, and used advanced production methods by Leon. The album cover, photographed by Punk magazine's Roberta Bayley, features the four members leaning against a brick wall in New York City. The record company paid only $125 for the front photo, which has since become one of the most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album's liner notes. After its release, Ramones was promoted with two singles which failed to chart. The Ramones also began touring to help sell records; these tour dates were mostly based in the United States, though two were booked in Britain. Violence, drug use, relationship issues, humor, and Nazism were prominent in the album's lyrics. The album opens with \""Blitzkrieg Bop\"", which is among the band's most recognized songs. Most of the album's tracks are uptempo, with many songs measuring at well over 160 beats per minute. The songs are also rather short; at two-and-a-half minutes, \""I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement\"" is the album's longest track. Ramones contains a cover of the Chris Montez song \""Let's Dance\"". Ramones peaked at No. 111 on the US Billboard 200 and was unsuccessful commercially; initially it received mixed reviews from the few critics who wrote about it. However, many later deemed it a highly influential record, and it has since received many accolades, such as the top spot on Spin magazine's list of the \""50 Most Essential Punk Records\"". Ramones went on to inspire many bands like the Sex Pistols, the Buzzcocks, and the Clash, among others. Aside from sparking the punk-rock scene in both the US and UK, it has had a significant impact on other genres of rock music, such as grunge and heavy metal. The album was ranked at number 33 in Rolling Stone's \""500 Greatest Albums of All Time\"" in 2012 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2014.",music,6
"Différences is a composition by the Italian composer Luciano Berio for flute, clarinet, viola, cello, harp and magnetic tape, dating 1958–59. It was written for the Domaine musical concerts in Paris and first performed in March 1959, conducted by Pierre Boulez. Différences is one of the first attempts to combine live instruments with electronic music. At the centre of the work, the tape sound takes the place of the performers. They return with various pizzicato entries, creating a homogeneous texture which seeks only an alteration in the expression rather than a disruption in the character of the music. Berio began the composition for Différences a year before the premiere by recording in Paris the same musicians who were to give the first performance. In the Studio di fonologia musicale in Milan he then transformed these recordings to produce the tape with which the musicians interact during the performance. Berio remarked that \""[i]n Différences the original model of the five instruments coexists alongside an image of itself that is continually modified, until the different phases of transformation deliver up a completely altered image that no longer has anything to do with the original\"" (, p. 126).",music,6

"Aerial Ballet is the third album by Harry Nilsson released in 1968. Aerial Ballet was Nilsson's second album for RCA Victor, and was titled after the highwire circus act of his grandparents. It consists almost entirely of songs written by him, including \""One\"", which later became a Number Five hit for Three Dog Night. (The song's opening line, \""One is the loneliest number\"", is a common phrase to this day, but very few people know who coined it.) The title of the album has been given by Joey Kramer as the inspiration for Aerosmith's name and wings motif. The most familiar track from Aerial Ballet is its one cover song, Fred Neil's \""Everybody's Talkin'\"". It was released as a single in North America in 1968, and reached the top forty in Canada—but initially flopped in the US. However, the song was subsequently selected for use in the Oscar-winning film Midnight Cowboy and became one of Nilsson's biggest hits as a performer, hitting the US top ten in 1969. Another song, \""Little Cowboy\"", later featured in The Courtship of Eddie's Father, was written by Nilsson's mother. The original opening number for Aerial Ballet was \""Daddy's Song\"", but this track was removed (apparently without Nilsson's awareness) after the first copies were issued, because The Monkees had recorded a cover version to be featured in their film Head, and had paid $35,000 for exclusive rights to the song. The CD reissue restores \""Daddy's Song\"" (with the Monkees' contract long expired) to its rightful place in the lineup. When Nilsson visited the Beatles in London during 1968, John Lennon played Nilsson \""Revolution\"" and selections from the (then-upcoming) 'White Album', and Nilsson in turn played to Lennon (who had spent thirty-six hours listening to Nilsson's previous album, Pandemonium Shadow Show) a demo cut of this record.",music,6

M.I.A.'s debut studio album, Arular, was initially scheduled to be released in September 2004, but the release was delayed by six months due to problems with the clearance of samples used in the songs. She released two singles and a mixtape in the interim.

"Wicked: The Untold Story of the Witches of Oz is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman. It is based on the 1995 Gregory Maguire novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, an alternative telling of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz and L. Frank Baum's classic 1900 story, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The musical is told from the perspective of the witches of the Land of Oz; its plot begins before and continues after Dorothy's arrival in Oz from Kansas, and it includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel. Wicked tells the story of two unlikely friends, Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West) and Galinda (whose name later changes to Glinda the Good Witch), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the Wizard's corrupt government and, ultimately, Elphaba's public fall from grace. Produced by Universal Stage Productions in coalition with Marc Platt, Jon B. Platt and David Stone, with direction by Joe Mantello and choreography by Wayne Cilento, the original production of Wicked premiered on Broadway at the Gershwin Theatre in October 2003, after completing pre-Broadway tryouts at San Francisco's Curran Theatre in April 2003. Its original stars included Idina Menzel as Elphaba, Kristin Chenoweth as Glinda, and Joel Grey as the Wizard. The original Broadway production won three Tony Awards and six Drama Desk Awards, while its original cast album received a Grammy Award. Wicked celebrated its tenth anniversary on Broadway on October 30, 2013. On February 14, 2016, Wicked performed its 5124th performance with a 2 p.m. matinee, making  Wicked the 10th longest-running Broadway show, passing Rent. A typical performance runs for approximately two hours and 30 minutes, plus a 15-minute intermission. The success of the Broadway production has spawned several other productions worldwide, including various North American productions, a long-running Laurence Olivier Award–nominated West End production and a series of international productions. Since its 2003 debut, Wicked has broken box office records around the world, currently holding weekly-gross-takings records in Los Angeles, Chicago, St. Louis and London. In the week ending January 2, 2011, the London, Broadway and both North American touring productions simultaneously broke their respective records for the highest weekly gross. In the final week of 2013, the Broadway production broke this record again, earning $3.2 million.

"\""Sit Down\"" is a song by James, originally released in 1989 by Rough Trade Records. In its seven-and-a-half-minute original form, the song only reached number 77 in the UK Singles Chart (although it did make number 8 in John Peel's Festive Fifty of that year). Due to this unimpressive performance their record label's managing director, Geoff Travis, told the band they were not a viable commercial proposition beyond an audience of 20,000. The song's lyrics were written in the autumn of 1988 as a thank-you to two women who greatly inspired Tim Booth: author Doris Lessing and singer Patti Smith. After experiencing success as part of the Madchester music scene, a new version was released in March 1991 that was rockier, shorter and with new lyrics. It reached number 2 in the Singles Chart, spending three weeks there. It was the 20th best-selling single of 1991 in the UK, one of the highest selling singles of the year not to reach number one. After the release of their 'Best Of' album, the song was remixed by Apollo 440 and released as a single for a third time in November 1998, reaching number 7 (making it their biggest hit since the 1991 release). The band had to sell the rights to the song to Mercury Records to help pay off debts to the record company. In 2006, Sit Down was used as a featured song in BBC Three's Manchester Passion, in which lead singer, Tim Booth, also appeared as Judas Iscariot. Darren Morfitt in the role of Jesus sang a less upbeat rendition of the piece to his resting disciples while the presenter hand-signalled the audience to literally sit down. Although Booth did not perform the song during the show, he did sing it in an encore after the credits rolled. In 2013, Sit Down placed 4th in a poll by BBC Radio 2 and the Official Charts Company to find the greatest track to miss out on the number one spot in the UK charts. In the same year, James performed the song with Peter Kay for Comic Relief.",music,6

"The Toccata for Two Pianos is a work by Germaine Tailleferre, written in 1957 for the American two-piano team Gold and Fizdale, to whom it is dedicated. The work was published in 1999 by the French music publisher Musik Fabrik. The work is composed of two motives: a rapid passage of widely spaced intervals which alternates between the two pianos and a bi-tonal \""taxi\""-like motive which enters in a cyclical passage. After a slower passage using irregular time signatures and \""Stravinskian\"" polytonality, the initial material is presented in a fugato, which brings the work to a brisk close. A typical performance takes about four minutes. In Georges Hacquard's catalog of Tailleferre's works, there is an orchestration by French composer Désiré Dondeyne listed as being \""inserted into the orchestral score of 'La nouvelle Cythère', but this orchestration was never reallzed. It is thought that Georges Hacquard asked Dondeyne to orchestrate this so that the 1929 ballet would correspond to a scenario that Hacquard had written for it. It is difficult, given the pianistic nature of this work, to imagine a version for any other instrumentation.",music,6

"\""Twist of Love\"" was the Danish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, performed in English by Sidsel Ben Semmane. As Denmark had finished in the top 10 in the 2005 contest, the song was pre-qualified for the final. Here, it was performed ninth, following Germany's Texas Lightning with \""No No Never\"" and preceding Russia's Dima Bilan with \""Never Let You Go\"". At the close of voting, it had received 26 points, placing 18th in a field of 24 and meaning that Denmark would have to qualify through the semi-final at their next Contest appearance. The song describes the attempts of \""this guy called Johnny\"" to catch the eye of \""Connie\"", a girl who is also being pursued by \""O'Smarty\"". In the event, it turns out that O'Smarty is unable to dance the twist, while Johnny's prowess means that he wins the girl.Fittingly, the music is heavily inspired by early rock-n-roll. Indeed, the guitar solo was performed at the Contest in a manner similar to the iconic scene in the Back to the Future film. The song had divided opinion prior to the Contest, with many fans arguing that the lyrics were excessively silly - particularly the names of the characters. Following the Contest, the song was covered by South African boy band Hi-5 as \""Die Twist\"" (The Twist). It was succeeded as Danish representative at the 2007 Contest by DQ with \""Drama Queen\"". Due to a change of the rules at the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix the year before, songs could be performed in any language chosen as opposed to all being in Danish and the winning song translated into English for the Eurovision night. As a result, this entry was the first ever Danish entry which did not have a Danish language version in existence.

"\""Long Haired Lover from Liverpool\"" is a pop song by Little Jimmy Osmond. Written by Christopher Kingsley (somehow credited as Christopher Dowden on the UK release) and produced by Mike Curb and Perry Botkin Jr, \""Long Haired Lover from Liverpool\"" was a UK number one single for Jimmy Osmond. Riding high on the popularity of The Osmonds, Jimmy (the youngest sibling) had a massive hit with the song, in the process becoming the youngest person to ever reach number one on the UK Singles Chart aged 9 years 8 months. A UK number one for five weeks in December 1972, it was the Christmas number one that year, and has since sold over a million copies in the UK. It also reached #2 on the Australian Singles Chart (Kent Music Report) and #38 on the US, Billboard Hot 100. Kingsley's 1969 version was an unsuccessful single, played by then-popular MOR station KMPC, Los Angeles. However, Kingsley's record distributed by MGM, where the Osmonds recorded, was where Jimmy's mother first heard \""Long Haired Lover From Liverpool\"" and thought it would be a great song for the youngest member of the Osmond family. Mike Curb, president of MGM and producer of the Osmonds agreed and recorded Jimmy. The timing could not have been better, as Osmond-mania was sweeping the UK and the Osmond family was embarking on a major UK-European promotional tour. Politics at the UK record company almost stopped the record from being released as a single, but through the efforts of Virgin Ear Music (a Richard Kaye Publishing Company - worldwide copyright owner of \""Long Haired Lover From Liverpool\"") and his UK sub-publishers the Little Jimmy Osmond record was released.",music,6

"\""My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)\"" is the solo debut single for former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin, released on Motown Records in early 1969 (see 1969 in music). The song was written by Harvey Fuqua, Johnny Bristol, Pam Sawyer, and James Roach, with its melody and intro based upon the classical music piece \""Frühlingslied\"" by Felix Mendelssohn. Fuqua and Bristol handled the recording's production. Ruffin had been dismissed from the Temptations in June 1968 for what has been repeatedly deemed increasingly unprofessional behavior. The song was originally intended to be sung by the Temptations when Ruffin was still the group's front man, but when he finally agreed to a solo contract with Motown, the song was given to him. A bittersweet ballad in the style of \""Since I Lost My Baby\"", \""All I Need\"", \""I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)\"", \""(Loneliness Made Me Realize) It's You That I Need\"", \""(I Know) I'm Losing You\"" and \""I Wish It Would Rain\"", Ruffin, as the narrator, sings of the extensive pain he has felt since his lover has left him. All throughout the song, Ruffin asks his lover why she left him, what he did wrong that drove her away, and professes to her that without her, his life is meaningless. Singing backup for Ruffin on the recording are The Originals, who the same year would score a hit of their own with \""Baby I'm For Real\"". \""My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)\"" was the focal point of Ruffin's debut solo LP, My Whole World Ended. It peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the Billboard R&B Singles chart. Only one more of Ruffin's solo singles, 1975's Walk Away from Love, would match its success. The song was covered by The Chi-Lites on their 1969 debut album Give It Away, and by The Spinners on their 1970 second album 2nd Time Around.",music,6

"\""Young Guns (Go for It)\"" (mostly written with an exclamation mark as \""Young Guns (Go for It!)\"") is a song by British pop duo Wham! which was released in 1982 on Innervision Records. It was written by George Michael, one half of the duo. The song was Wham!'s first hit, although it came with some help from the BBC music programme Top of the Pops, which invited Wham! on to the show as a last-minute replacement for another act which had pulled out. It helped that the producer of Top of the Pops had seen them previously on another programme: Saturday Superstore. Wham! were just outside the Top 40 threshold of the UK Singles Chart at the time, which meant they had not climbed high enough in normal circumstances to get on the show, but they were recruited nonetheless as the highest-placed artists still climbing the charts from outside the 40. The song entered the chart initially at Number 73, went up to Number 48, then dropped to Number 52 and the week after that, it jumped to Number 42. Their appearance on Top of the Pops broke the record wide open and on the following Monday the distribution centre received some thirty thousand orders. This sent the record to Number 24 before eventually peaking at Number 3 in November 1982. George wrote the song about a teenage lad's worry that his best friend was getting too committed to a girl when he should have been enjoying his youth and the single life. It featured a middle eight aside in which the girl conversely tried to get her boyfriend to ditch the best friend, prompting a vocal battle, akin to a tug of war, between the girlfriend and the best friend which prompted the \""go for it!\"" aspect of the song, as featured in the title. On Top of the Pops, George mimed the vocals to his Wham! partner Andrew Ridgeley, who \""acted\"" the part of the teenage bridegroom-in-waiting. They were flanked by backing singers Dee C. Lee and Shirlie Holliman. The original recording does not feature the voices of Lee and Holliman but that of singer Lynda Haynes.",music,6

"In a Summer Garden is a fantasy for orchestra composed in 1908 by Frederick Delius; it was first performed in London under the composer's baton on December 11 of that year. The piece is built around several distinct themes. The first appears in the woodwinds and strings; the second is presented by the English horn, while the third is scored for violas against figures and chords in the woodwinds and lower strings. This is worked out vigorously before the piece is concluded by a new theme, first from the violins and repeated by the woodwinds. The published score of the fantasy contains two quotations which provide some clue as to its emotional content. The first is a couplet by Dante Gabriel Rossetti: All are my blooms; and all sweet blooms of love.To thee I gave while Spring and Summer sang.The origin of the second quote is unknown. It reads: Roses, lilies, and a thousand scented flowers. Bright butterflies, flitting from petal to petal. Beneath the shade of ancient trees, a quiet river with water lilies. In a boat, almost hidden, two people. A thrush is singing in the distance. The first broadcast performance was conducted by Edward Clark.

"Rue Laffitte is a street in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, located near the Metro stations Richelieu - Drouot and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. This street was created in 1771 between the Boulevard des Italiens and the Rue de Provence. Its original name was Rue d'Artois, in honour of the Comte d'Artois, brother of the king Louis XVI, later king of France with the name of Charles X. But in 1792, during the French Revolution, the prince had emigrated outside France and the street was renamed Rue Cerutti. Giuseppe Cerutti was an Italian writer living in a mansion in the street at the junction with the Boulevard des Italiens. He was a former Jesuit, became Republican and was elected to the French National Assembly. He wrote the eulogy of Mirabeau. He died the same year (1791) and the street was renamed in his honour. Louis Napoleon, the future Napoleon III, was born at number 15 on 20 April 1808. After the Bourbon Restoration, the street's name was changed back to Rue d'Artois. In 1826, the street was lengthened to the street of Rue Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, in the field of Hôtel Thellusson, which was destroyed.The French financier and politician Jacques Laffitte (1767–1844) had his mansion at number 27. On 30 July 1830, with Adolphe Thiers and La Fayette, he took part in the Revolution of 1830: they offered the crown to the future king Louis-Philippe of France, because King Charles X had allowed soldiers to shoot civilians and because they feared that a republic would lead to disorder and foreign wars. In December 1830, Laffitte was President of the French Council of Ministers and the street was renamed after him. Laffitte shares with Victor Hugo the honour of having lived in a street bearing his name.

In early 2009, a single daily passenger service was introduced by East Midlands Trains between Melton Mowbray and St Pancras via Corby, the first regular daily passenger service to operate across the viaduct since the 1960s. The viaduct is also used as a diversionary route for East Midlands Trains mainline services using the Midland Main Line route. The line and structure, dominating this picturesque rural valley, are a favourite with steam train and heritage enthusiasts alike. The first brick was laid in March 1876 and the last arch was finished in July 1878. Due to the structure's size, age, exposure and inaccessibility, the original brickwork was suffering from extensive weathering and structural deterioration. As part of the Network Rail Structures maintenance programme, Birse Rail was remitted to carry out structural repairs to the viaduct. Traditional methods and materials were employed alongside modern access techniques to return the structure to its former glory and to ensure the long-term structural integrity of the viaduct, as well as the enjoyment of generations to come. Welland Viaduct from Seaton in 2009 The viaduct was originally built from bricks manufactured and fired onsite which had a red face. Repairs have employed other types of bricks, predominantly blue engineering bricks which have better water resistance and are much stronger than commons making them excellent for arch re-lining and face brick replacement, leaving a patchwork appearance. Before the extensive privatisation of British Rail, repairs were regularly made to the structure by the Kettering and Leicester civil engineering staff. Many of the older bricklayers reported having seen the imprints of children's hands and feet in the bricks, from where they had walked on the clay-filled moulds before firing in the kiln.",transportation,10
"The Samjhauta Express (Hindi: समझौता एक्सप्रेस, Urdu: سمجھوتا اکسپريس‎ Punjabi language: ਸਮਝੌਤਾ ਐਕਸਪ੍ਰੈਸ / سمجھوتا اکسپريس ) commonly called the Friend Express, is a twice-weekly train – Tuesdays and Fridays – that runs between Delhi and Attari in India and Lahore in Pakistan. The word Samjhauta means \""agreement\"", \""accord\"" and \""compromise\"" in both Hindi and Urdu. Until the reopening of the Thar Express, this was the only rail connection between the two countries. The train was started on 22 July 1976 following the Shimla Agreement and ran between Amritsar and Lahore, a distance of about 42 km. Following disturbances in Punjab in the late eighties, due to security reasons Indian Railways decided to terminate the service at Attari, where customs and immigration clearances take place. On 14 April 2000, in an agreement between Indian Railways and Pakistan Railways (PR), the distance was revised to cover just under three km. It was a daily train when the service started, and changed to a bi-weekly schedule in 1994. Earlier the rakes were returned to the home country the same day but later in 2000 the rake remained overnight at that location. Its termini are Lahore in Pakistan and Delhi in India. The border crossing takes place between Wagah in Pakistan and Attari in India. Originally, this was a through service with the same rake going all the way between the termini; later the Pakistani rake stopped at Attari at which point passengers had to change trains. Now there is a train from Delhi to Attari where all passengers alight for customs and immigration. This train does not have any commercial stops between Delhi and Attari. It is incorrectly referred to as the Samjhauta Express and it is officially known as the Delhi-Attari or Attari-Delhi Express. The actual Samjhauta Express runs from Attari to Lahore, although the passengers are checked at Wagah, the first station on the Pakistani side. The train service was set up with an agreement between Indian Railways (IR) and Pakistan Railways (PR) to alternately use an Indian and a Pakistani rake and locomotive for the train, six months at a time. The train usually has between four and eight coaches. The rake supplied by Pakistan is usually hauled by an Alco DL-543 class ALU20 diesel loco (Lahore shed), with the entire train in the standard dark green livery of PR. The train's first break of service was when it was discontinued on 1 January 2002 in the wake of the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament on 13 December 2001. Service resumed on 15 January 2004. Service was also suspended following the 27 December 2007, assassination of Benazir Bhutto as a preventive measure to deny militants a \""high-value target\"" that was of great symbolic importance to both India and Pakistan. On 8 October 2012, police recovered about 100 kg of contraband heroin and more than 500 rounds of bullet ammunition at Wagah border on the train heading for Delhi.",transportation,10

"The North Chester Line was a line of the Bakersfield and Kern Electric Railway. The route originated at the intersection of 19th Street and Chester Avenue, and traveled north on Chester. For most of its life, the line was combined with the West 19th Street Line. The line was constructed in 1903, as part of the original expansion plan. It closed in 1933. The line was originally single track, constructed with 36-pound rails. It would run on Chester Avenue, until 24th Street. It would then, turn east for one block. The line would then turn north again, on K Street. It would continue north and terminate at the Southern Pacific railroad tracks. In 1911, the line would see two major changes. The K Street section would be realigned to Chester Avenue (terminate at the Southern Pacific Chester Station), making the route straight. Although the franchise, granted to the company, allowed the line to be constructed to 34th Street, it was not constructed north of 32nd Street. This was most likely because of the cost involved in crossing the Southern Pacific tracks. The line was also double tracked and replaced with 87-pound rails. The 1930 timetable showed trains running every 20 minutes. However, revenue for the streetcar line was declining. On July 24, 1933, the line was abandoned. It would also remove the obstacle to the construction of Garces Circle (which is just south of the Southern Pacific tracks).",transportation,10

"The Córdoba & Rosario Railway (C&R) (in Spanish: Ferrocarril Córdoba y Rosario) was a British-owned railway company, founded in 1889, that operated a 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3⁄8 in) metre gauge railway network in Santa Fe Province, Argentina. The company was sold to the Córdoba Central Railway (CC) in 1912. The C&R was founded in 1889 to acquire a concession, granted to William Temple in 1886 by the province of Santa Fe, for the construction of a line, 222 km long, from the river port of Rosario to San Francisco which would provide a link with the CC which had completed the building of a line from Córdoba to San Francisco the previous year. The section from San Francisco to Rafaela, later to be known as the \""Rafaela Steam Tramway\"", was finished in 1890 and a year later the Rosario to Frontera line was completed. It was now possible to operate through trains from Rosario north to Tucumán via San Francisco and Córdoba in conjunction with the Córdoba Central. Once the CC had completed the construction of a line from Buenos Aires to Rosario in 1912 through trains could reach Tucumán from the capital for the first time. Close collaboration between the two companies led finally to the purchase of the Córdoba & Rosario by the CC in 1913. Finally the Córdoba Central would be added to Ferrocarril Belgrano network after all the Argentine railways were nationalised in 1948.",transportation,10
"College's Crossing (also known as Colleges Crossing) is a low level bridge that crosses Brisbane River at Chuwar, a suburb of Ipswich in South East Queensland, Australia. The road across the bridge is Mount Crosby Road. During major floods or water releases from the Wivenhoe Dam the road becomes impassable. The crossing was constructed to replace a previous structure which had been washed away during floods. It was opened in 1894 with a ceremony that was attended by the Mayor of Ipswich, H.E. Wyman. College's Crossing is named after George College (sometimes spelled Colledge), one of the first settlers who bought a land on the north side of the Brisbane River in 1854. It was the first river crossing in the district which allowed access across the river before the first bridge was constructed. Located here is a park, known as Colleges Crossing Recreational Reserve, which is a popular picnic and tourist spot for the residents of Brisbane and Ipswich from the early 1920s. It was completely destroyed during the 2010-11 floods, which saw a rise in the water level of over 17 metres with strong currents. The park was equipped with barbecues, playground facilities, a cafe, lookouts, boat ramp, bird hide and clean water for drinking. Swimming, canoeing, kayaking and fishing are also popular in the area. Four and half kilometres upstream from Colleges Crossing is the Mount Crosby Weir and Mount Crosby Pumping Station. Downstream from the crossing swimming is not recommended due to the presence of bull sharks and due to poor water quality.

"The Barryville–Shohola Bridge is the fifth generation of bridges constructed over the Delaware River at the communities of Shohola Township, Pennsylvania and Barryville, New York. The bridge serves both communities, with two major state legislative highways, Pennsylvania Traffic Route 434 and New York State Touring Route 55 (along with the co-designation of Sullivan County Route 11). The bridge itself is 812 feet (247 m) long and is 23 feet (7.0 m) wide, using four total spans across the river. It is maintained by the NY–PA Joint Interstate Bridge Commission, which is jointly owned by the states of New York and Pennsylvania. The area of the bridge itself dates as a ford for Native Americans, mostly the Lenni Lenapi, traveling between from the Wyoming valley and Delaware Valley and present-day Connecticut in the early 18th century; archaeologists date human habitation and use of the area to 10,900 BCE. The river at Shohola, which means \""place of peace,\"" widens perceptibly above the falls, allowing for a natural, shallow crossing. By the early 19th century, a ferry facilitated crossing the river. Due to the construction of the nearby Delaware and Hudson Canal in 1827, commerce and business boomed in the area. In 1856, a bridge company, under the leadership of Chauncey Thomas, constructed a span between the two communities, but it was poorly designed and collapsed during a windstorm in 1859. Thomas then constructed a suspension bridge, but its cables snapped in 1865. In 1866, the bridge was reconstructed as a two-lane, single span wooden suspension structure and remained in use for over seventy years. Ownership changed several times, eventually ending with the bridge in the control of the Joint Delaware River Bridge Commission. The bridge was replaced again in 1941 for $174,300 (1941 USD ($2,804,200 in 2017)), with a steel truss span. This structure lasted another sixty-five years, finally deteriorating until the demolition of the structure in 2007, upon completion of the new bridge.",transportation,10

"Skylink is an automated people mover system operating at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). It is an application of the Bombardier Innovia APM 200 system manufactured by Bombardier Transportation, and continues to be maintained and operated by Bombardier. When it opened, it was the world's largest airport train system. Sixty-four Skylink trains are in service at DFW. Skylink was developed as a replacement for the Airtrans APM, the airport's original people mover system that connected airport facilities and parking lots. As DFW became a large connecting hub for flights, Airtrans (which was slow, followed a uni-directional counter-clockwise loop, and was located outside the secured area, thus requiring passengers to re-enter through security) was inefficient in moving passengers. The system was opened in Spring 2005, together with International Terminal D, and is completely automated. Skylink trains run every two minutes and travel at speeds up to 35–37 mph (56–60 km/h). The Skylink system is airside at DFW, serving passengers connecting between flights. There is no need to leave security and be re-screened when switching terminals. The system is only accessible airside and cannot be accessed by those not arriving at DFW or who have not cleared security. Arriving International passengers (who are not pre-cleared; e.g. Canada) who are connecting clear US CBP formalities and are then security screened before access to the terminals. Departing international passengers connecting from domestic or pre-cleared international flights do not need to be re-screened. The longest trip between farthest stations is 9 minutes with an average 5 minute journey. This allows most passengers to make a connection from any one flight to another in around seven minutes, not including walking time to and from the stations. The concrete and steel guideway for Skylink was constructed above the terminals on 375 columns in a 4.8 mile long bi-directional loop. The inner track travels clockwise and the outer track travels counter-clockwise. Each of the five current terminals contains 2 stations which are accessed on the secure (air) side. Unlike the previous Airtrans APM system, Skylink only connects terminals and does not travel to the airport's parking lots or rental car facility. The stations contain four sets of doors on each platform, with only the front 2 currently in operation pending future increased demand. Two more stations can be constructed for a sixth terminal if it is built. The Innovia APM 200 technology is also used at London Heathrow International Airport's T5 terminal as well as the PHX Sky Train. During severe weather, SkyLink service will be suspended, requiring long walks in between gates and exiting security in order to access Terminal E.",transportation,10

"The Gaviota Tunnel (officially known as the Gaviota Gorge Tunnel) is a tunnel on U.S. Route 101 completed in 1953 in the center of Gaviota State Park, 33 miles (53 km) northwest of Santa Barbara, California. It is 420 feet (130 m) long and 17.5 feet (5.3 m) tall. Only the northbound lanes of U.S. Route 101 (El Camino Real) pass through it, as the southbound lanes descend from Gaviota Pass through a narrow canyon to the west of the tunnel. Because it is the only major route between the Santa Barbara County South Coast and the Santa Ynez Valley, bicycles are allowed through it. There is a rest area on the southern end of the tunnel, the southernmost one along U.S. Route 101. There are frequent rockslides in the area, especially during and following rain. Some of the hillsides and road cuts are covered in netting to prevent erosion. There are also fences made of netting along the roadway to stop rocks that do fall. An alternate bypass to this section of U.S. Route 101 between Santa Barbara and Los Olivos is provided by State Route 154 capped by the Cold Spring Canyon Arch Bridge near the summit of San Marcos Pass.

"State Route 116 in Tennessee runs from its junction with State Route 62 at its southwestern end between Wartburg and Coalfield in Morgan County, to its northeastern end at Caryville, Tennessee in Campbell County. From its southwestern terminus it heads northeast and passes through the town of Petros and past Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary. Continuing northeast into Anderson County, the highway then passes through remote mountainous country known for its many former coal mining villages, some of which were company towns and are now essentially ghost towns. Among them are the towns (or former towns) of Fork Mountain, Buffalo, Devonia (a/k/a Moore's Camp), Braytown, Rosedale, and Charley's Branch. The Devonia post office which served this entire region was closed in 1975. Once the mines in these towns closed down with the resulting loss of population, the towns' schools were closed and remaining students were consolidated into the Rosedale school, which saw steadily falling enrollment and was closed in the 1990s. This section of Route 116 parallels the New River and the former line of the Tennessee Railroad. There are many abandoned underground coal mines, coal tipples, and railroad yards and sidings along this section of Route 116. Despite the end of most underground mining and the demise of the towns along this portion of the highway, a great deal of strip mining continues however. Route 116 briefly passes into Campbell County and then turns southeast back into Anderson County. From there it passes through the village of Stainville and continues southeast through some remote, sparsely populated mountains to Laurel Grove. There it turns northeast again at the junction with Frost Bottom Road, since 1982 designated as State Route 330. This section of the highway parallels Walden Ridge to the immediate southeast, and a former spur of the Norfolk Southern Railway (now closed), and passes through Briceville, Fraterville which was the site of a 1902 mine explosion, \""The Wye\"" near the former mining camp of Beech Grove, and finally through a gap in Walden Ridge to enter Rocky Top. Originally the northeastern terminus of Route 116 was in Rocky Top at the junction with U.S. 25W. About 1982, Route 116 was extended northward to Caryville to incorporate the portion of the former U.S. 25W between Rocky Top and Caryville superseded by Interstate 75. This addition to Route 116 parallels the busy railroad lines of both the CSX and Norfolk Southern, and Interstate 75 immediately to the west. Petros, Briceville, Rocky Top, and Caryville are the only towns of any sizeable population today along Route 116. The highway has had a high rate of accidents, including fatal accidents, attributed to conditions including narrow shoulders, numerous curves, unstable slopes, rockfall hazards, and absence of guardrails. In 2013, the Tennessee Department of Transportation announced plans for $1.2 million in roadway improvements, including widening of shoulders and addition of guardrails, pavement markings and signs.",transportation,10

"The Windsor Bridge, officially called the Hawkesbury River Bridge, Windsor, a beam bridge across the Hawkesbury River, is located in Windsor in north–western Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The bridge was built in 1874 for horse-drawn vehicles and foot traffic and now carries road traffic. The bridge is listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. The Windsor Bridge has a high level of historic, technical, aesthetic and social significance as an important historical and physical landmark in one of the State's pre-eminent historic towns, and in the wider Sydney region. It is the oldest extant crossing of the Hawkesbury River. Together with the successive crossings upstream at Richmond, this bridge has played a major role in shaping the history of the Hawkesbury area, functioning for well over a century as an all important link between the communities on either side of the River and as an essential component in a through route of importance in the development of the Sydney region. The series of major alterations to the structure since its construction articulate the continuing difficulties of negotiating a crossing of this major waterway with its frequent floods. The Windsor Bridge has landmark qualities as one of only two bridge crossings of the Hawkesbury River in the Hawkesbury area and as such it defines the surrounding network of roads. It is a large structure, and although simple in appearance, impressive. The bridge represents a major engineering project in the State for its time. The addition of a reinforced concrete beam deck to replace the timber deck in the 1920s is a relatively early use of this technology. The River and this crossing of it has defined the life of several generations of local inhabitants on both sides of the River. As the suburban outskirts of Sydney widen and come closer to the still distinct and distinctive Macquarie towns, the rich history of the area and its physical remains become increasingly important to the community's sense of identity. The Windsor Bridge is thus an important part of Windsor's history and identity.— Statement of significance, Heritage and conservation register, Roads & Maritime Services, 21 October 2004.",transportation,10

The highway also serves as the primary route from Toronto to southern Georgian Bay and Muskoka, areas collectively known as cottage country. The highway is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police and has a speed limit of 100 km/h (62 mph), except for the section south of the 401, where the speed limit is 80 km/h (50 mph). Highway 400 is the second longest freeway in the province, the trans-provincial Highway 401 being the longest. It was the first fully controlled-access highway in Ontario when it was opened between North York and Barrie on July 1, 1952. On that date, it was also the first highway to be designated as a 400-series. The freeway was extended in both directions; north of Barrie to Coldwater in 1958, and south of Highway 401 to Jane Street in 1966. It was widened between North York and Barrie in the 1970s. Since 1977, construction on the freeway has been snaking north along Highway 69 towards Parry Sound and now Sudbury. As of 2011, a four lane freeway is opened as far north as Carling. At the north end of Highway 69, a segment of freeway is in operation between north of the French River and Sudbury; while this section will be part of the completed Highway 400 route, at present it remains signed as Highway 69. The remaining gap between Carling and north of the French River will be opened in stages and is expected to be completed by 2021.",transportation,10

"The Brooker Highway (sometimes referred to as the Northern Outlet) is a highway in the State of Tasmania, Australia. As one of Hobart's 3 major radials, the highway connects traffic from the Hobart city centre with the northern suburbs and is the major road connection to the cities and towns of Northern Tasmania. With an AADT of 48,000, the highway is one of the busiest in Tasmania. The Brooker Highway has recently been declared part of the National Highway. The Brooker Highway runs approximately 17 km (11 mi) north from the CBD, through the northern suburbs of Hobart, and through the City of Glenorchy, bypassing commercial and industrial centres along the original Main Road. It is primarily a four lane (dual-carriageway) highway, and apart from the Domain Highway junction, only the northern sections of the highway have grade separated junctions. The remainder of the junctions are regulated by traffic light and roundabout intersections. While the highway is substantially less congested than in other states during peak hours, it is more congested off-peak than roads in Queensland, Western Australia, and almost as congested as those in New South Wales. It is thus a busy road by any Australian standard. The Brooker Highway is currently below the acceptable levels of service and congestion issues are expected to worsen significantly over the next 20 years with the Highway already approaching its designed capacity. A current proposal to convert the Southern Railway Line for use as a Light rail system has the potential to alleviate the Brooker Highway's traffic problems.",transportation,10

"New York State Route 308 (NY 308) is a short state highway, 6.19 miles (9.96 km) in length, located entirely in northern Dutchess County, in the U.S. state of New York. It is a major collector road through mostly rural areas that serves primarily as a shortcut for traffic from the two main north–south routes in the area, U.S. Route 9 (US 9) and NY 9G, to get to NY 199 and the Taconic State Parkway. The western end of NY 308 is located within the Rhinebeck Village Historic District, a 2.6-square-mile (6.7 km2) historic district comprising 272 historical structures. The highway passes near the Dutchess County Fairgrounds, several historical landmarks, and the Landsman Kill. Indicated by artifacts found near Lake Sepasco, a small lake along NY 308, the highway began its history in about 1685, when a group of Native Americans called the Sepasco built the Sepasco Trail; this trail ran from the Hudson River, eastward through modern-day Rhinebeck (then Sepasco or Sepascoot), and ended at Lake Sepasco, following roughly Route 308 and its side roads. The trail remained until 1802, when part of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike — also known as the Salisbury Turnpike — was chartered over the trail and extended from Salisbury, Connecticut to the Susquehanna River at or near the Town of Jericho (now Bainbridge). Route 308 was designated as part of the 1930 renumbering of New York state highways, incorporating a portion of the former Ulster and Delaware Turnpike. The route originally extended from Milan westward to Rhinecliff to serve a ferry landing on the Hudson River. It was truncated to US 9 in the 1960s but its former routing to Rhinecliff is still state-maintained as an unsigned reference route. The highway was also intended to be part of the then-new Kingston–Rhinecliff Bridge until plans were changed to involve other routes and the building site for the bridge was moved about 3 miles (5 km) northward.",transportation,10

"The Common Tunnel (Norwegian: Fellestunnelen), sometimes called the Common Line (Fellesstrekningen), is a 7.3-kilometer (4.5 mi) long tunnel of the Oslo Metro which runs through the city center of Oslo, Norway. The name derives from the fact that all six lines of the metro use the tunnel, which runs from Majorstuen to Tøyen. The section has six stations, including the four busiest on the metro. The tunnel was first built as two separate tunnels which were later connected. The Holmenkolbanen company opened the western section of the tunnel from Majorstuen via Valkyrie plass to Nationaltheatret in 1928. In 1966, the Oslo Metro opened, including the tunnel from Tøyen via Grønland to Jernbanetorget. In 1977, the eastern end was extended to Sentrum, but the extension was closed in 1983 because of water leakages. In 1987, the Sentrum station reopened as Stortinget, and became the terminus of both the western and eastern lines. By 1993, the western end had been upgraded to metro standard, Valkyrie plass was closed, and the first trains ran through the whole tunnel. The section from Tøyen to Brynseng, although not completely located within the tunnel, is considered part of the Common Line. At Majorstuen, the line splits into three; the Røa Line, the Holmenkollen Line and the Sognsvann Line. At Tøyen, the line splits into the Lambertseter Line and the Grorud Line.

"The McMillin Bridge (also known as the Puyallup River Bridge) is a concrete half-through truss bridge crossing the Puyallup River, in Pierce County, Washington, built in 1966. The bridge is signed as part of State Route 162. The main span of the bridge is 170 feet (52 m) long, which was the longest beam span or concrete truss in the US when it was built. The bridge design uses a hollow-box system, which was suggested to the design company of W. H. Witt Company by Homer M. Hadley. The bridge was then built by Dolph Jones. The bridge was built to replace a steel span that had been washed out by the flooding river in 1933. Because of economic conditions the concrete design was chosen over a steel design, with a savings of $826, in addition to lower maintenance costs. The bridge is unusual in that it combines concrete with the half-through truss design, which was usually built with steel.

"The Central line is a London Underground line that runs through central London, from Ealing and Ruislip in the west to Epping, Essex in the north-east. Coloured red on the tube map, the line serves 49 stations, in 46 miles (74 km). It is the longest tube line. It is also one of only two lines on the London Underground network to cross the Greater London boundary, the other being the Metropolitan. One of London's deep-level tube railways, the trains are smaller than those on British main lines. The line was opened as the Central London Railway in 1900, crossing central London on an east-west axis, as the third deep-level tube line to be built after electric trains made them possible. It was later extended to the western suburb of Ealing. After the Second World War, the line was expanded considerably into the recently constructed suburbs, taking over steam-hauled outer suburban routes to the borders of London and beyond to the east. This realised plans that had been delayed by the war, when construction stopped and the unused tunnels were used as air-raid shelters and factories. However, suburban growth proved to be less than expected, and of the planned expansions one (to Denham) was cut short due to its location in the Metropolitan Green Belt and another (to Ongar) ultimately closed in 1994 due to low traffic. The Central line has mostly been operated by automatic train operation since a major refurbishment in the 1990s, although all trains still carry drivers. Many of its stations are of historic interest, from turn-of-the-century Central London Railway buildings in west London to post-war modernist designs on the West Ruislip and Hainault branches, as well as Victorian ECR and GER buildings east of Stratford, from when the line to Epping was a rural branch line. In terms of total passengers, the Central line is the busiest line on the London Underground. In the year 2011/12 over 260 million passenger journeys were made on the Central line. The line currently operates the second most frequent service on the London Underground with 34 trains per hour operating for half an hour in the westbound direction in the morning peak, and between 27tph and 30tph during the rest of the peak. This makes the line the busiest and most intensively used railway line in the United Kingdom: it is the only tube line running east-west through the central core of London, running under the shopping centre of Oxford Street and the financial centre of the City.

"Autoroute 13 (or A-13, also known as Autoroute Chomedey with sections formerly known as Autoroute Mirabel), is a freeway in the urban region of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Its southern end is at the junction of A-20 on the Island of Montreal near Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport. Its northern terminus is at the junction of A-640 near Boisbriand. The road traverses through Laval. Autoroute 13 was built as a toll highway in 1975 with a goal to connect the two international airports, Mirabel and Dorval (now Trudeau International Airport). The freeway is mostly six-laned and tolls no longer apply. The designation of Autoroute Chomedey refers to the community of Chomedey in Laval, through which A-13 passes. Formerly, common usage was to refer to the autoroute as Autoroute Chomedey south of the Milles-Îles river, and Autoroute Mirabel north of that point. In recent usage, however, the Autoroute Chomedey name is generally used for the full length of the autoroute. Boulevard Pitfield is routed as a parallel service road to A-13 in St-Laurent. Boulevard Pitfield derives its name from the origin of the actual route. In the 1920s, the actual route was a Polo Pony Trail leading from the various estates of the Saraguay Village residents to their Polo Fields, now where the area of St. Laurent Blvd and Bois Franc merge. In the late 1930s the path became an unpaved local road. Over the next several decades Saraguay Farms, owned by Mrs. W.C. Pitfield, was paid to clear the road in the winter by the municipality of St. Laurent. The road was developed into a two-lane highway in the 1960s. The Quebec provincial government was planning to extend Autoroute 13 north of A-640 in the late 1990s as an alternate route for A-15 (Autoroute Décarie/Autoroute des Laurentides). It is speculated this extension is less of a priority since Mirabel ceased passenger operations in 2004, and the Mirabel site is well-served by A-15 and A-50.",transportation,10

"Highway 99, also known as the Fraser Delta Thruway south of Vancouver, and the Sea to Sky Highway, the Squamish Highway, or Whistler Highway north of Vancouver, is the major north–south artery running through the Greater Vancouver area of British Columbia from the U.S. border, up Howe Sound through the Sea to Sky Country to Lillooet, and connecting to Highway 97 just north of Cache Creek. The number of this highway is derived from the old U.S. Route 99, with which the highway originally connected. The highway currently connects with Interstate 5 at the international border. This highway received the \""99\"" designation in 1942 after completion of the King George VI Highway (1940) to the U.S. border, and it originally shared an alignment with Highway 1 from Surrey to Vancouver via the Pattullo Bridge and Kingsway. The current freeway alignment of Highway 99 between 8th Avenue in South Surrey and the North Arm of the Fraser River opened in 1962 as Hwy. 99 and was called the Deas (Island) Throughway. Between 1964 and 1973, the freeway alignment of Highway 99 was designated Highway 499. The Oak Street Bridge was built in 1957 to cross the North Arm Fraser River, and the Deas Island Tunnel was built 1957–59 (renamed the George Massey Tunnel in 1967) to cross the Fraser River. Tolls were collected at the crossings but were rescinded by the provincial government around 1963–64. In 1957, the northern end of Highway 99 was moved from downtown Vancouver, across the Lions Gate Bridge and west to the village of Horseshoe Bay, following Marine Drive through West Vancouver.

"The Clifton Suspension Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Avon Gorge and the River Avon, linking Clifton in Bristol to Leigh Woods in North Somerset. Since opening in 1864, it has been a toll bridge. The income from the tolls continues to provide funds for its maintenance. The bridge is built to a design by William Henry Barlow and John Hawkshaw, based on an earlier design by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and contributed to by Sarah Guppy. It is a grade I listed building and forms part of the B3129 road. The idea of building a bridge across the Avon Gorge originated in 1753. Original plans were for a stone bridge and later iterations were for a wrought iron structure. In 1831, an attempt to build Brunel's design was halted by the Bristol riots, and the revised version of his designs was built after his death and completed in 1864. Although similar in size, the bridge towers are not identical in design, the Clifton tower having side cut-outs, the Leigh tower more pointed arches atop a 110-foot (34 m) red sandstone-clad abutment. Roller-mounted \""saddles\"" at the top of each tower allow movement of the three independent wrought iron chains on each side when loads pass over the bridge. The bridge deck is suspended by 162 vertical wrought-iron rods in 81 matching pairs. The Clifton Bridge Company initially managed the bridge under licence from a charitable trust. The trust subsequently purchased the company shares, completing this in 1949 and took over the running of the bridge using the income from tolls to pay for maintenance. The bridge is a distinctive landmark, used as a symbol of Bristol on postcards, promotional materials, and informational web sites. It was also used as a backdrop to several films and television advertising and programmes. It has also been the venue for significant cultural events such as the first modern bungee jump in 1979, the last ever Concorde flight in 2003 and a handover of the Olympic Torch relay in 2012.",transportation,10

"The original Maroon Creek Bridge is a steel trestle along State Highway 82 at the western boundary of Aspen, Colorado, United States. It was designed by George S. Morison in 1888 for the Colorado Midland Railroad, one of the last viaducts in Colorado built for a standard gauge mountain railroad in the 19th century. Of the five steel bridges the Midland built, it is the only one still extant. Due to the later removal of most track and the rail depots, the bridge is the most visible remnant of rail service to Aspen. In 1985 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with other highway bridges in the state, including the Sheely Bridge, also in Aspen. When it was built, the Midland was ahead in its race with the Denver and Rio Grande to make the first rail connection to Aspen, then a booming silver mining center. The Midland had followed the Roaring Fork Valley up from its main line at Glenwood Springs, but was stalled at Maroon Creek by a delay in the bridge steel. The Rio Grande was thus able to make up the difference and bring the first train to Aspen, with the Midland following a few months later. Aspen's boom years ended a few years later, and by the 1920s the bridge was abandoned. It was soon expanded and converted to use as a road bridge. It served as the main entrance to Aspen for many visitors as the city's economy rebounded when the Aspen Mountain ski resort was developed after World War II. As growth spilled over to Aspen's west, it became a traffic choke point for the region. It remained in use until longstanding plans for a newer, wider bridge came to fruition in 2008. At that time the original bridge was the oldest one still in use on Colorado's state highways. The award-winning new bridge was designed to be aesthetically similar to its predecessor, which remains in service as a foot bridge. It may be used for a light rail line to further alleviate traffic problems in the valley.",transportation,10

"The Midtown corridor refers to three new GO Transit services in Metrolinx's regional transportation plan for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, The Big Move. The first is a Crosstown line from Dundas Street to the former Canadian Pacific North Toronto and Leaside stations in Toronto. The second and third segments would extend east from North Toronto and/or Union Station: the Seaton line to Seaton, and the Locust Hill line to Locust Hill. GO Transit has contemplated a Midtown corridor since the 1980s as a contingency plan once capacity at Union Station became constrained, making North Toronto an alternate station for Downtown Toronto. The major barrier to these plans, however, is the fact that the Midtown corridor is composed of existing rail lines owned and actively used by Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) as its main freight line between Ottawa, Montreal, London and Windsor. CP has been reluctant to provide capacity to GO Transit on its tracks, and the Milton line (which runs along CP tracks to the west) only came after considerable negotiations, and an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars. All three lines in the corridor were listed under the 15-year plan of The Big Move upon its publication in 2008. However the Havelock line was moved to the 25-year plan on February 14, 2013, because of \""very modest ridership potential and significant infrastructure and operational challenges related to the Agincourt rail yards.\""",transportation,10

"The Seelisberg Tunnel is a motorway tunnel in Switzerland. The tunnel links Beckenried, in the canton of Nidwalden, with Seedorf, in the canton of Uri, running under the mountains that form the south shore of Lake Lucerne. It forms part of the A2 motorway between Basel, on the border with Germany and France, and Chiasso, on the border with Italy. Completed in 1980, the twin bores of the tunnel are 9,250 metres (30,350 ft) and 9,292 metres (30,486 ft) in length. After the Gotthard Road Tunnel, this is Switzerland's second-longest road tunnel but unlike the Gotthard Tunnel which crosses the Alps completely north to south, the Seelisberg Tunnel is situated only in the northern side of Alps. The Seelisberg tunnel can be considered to be the longest Swiss Road tunnel with split traffic (Southbound in one bore, and Northbound in another one). Proponents for a second Gotthard Road Tunnel bore refer to the Seelisberg Tunnel, which they claim, due to split traffic, results in not only smoother traffic, but blocked traffic only on one side in the case of an accident inside the tunnel. However, opponents of the second Gotthard Road Tunnel have indicated that such measure would severely hinder the strategy of the transfer of marchandise from road to rail. Furthermore, in terms of safety, it might be worth noticing, that despite the fact that the Seelisberg Tunnel, is much shorter in length (9 km) as opposed to the Saint Gotthard Tunnel (16 km) and that it carries far less traffic than the Saint Gotthard Tunnel, according to the Swiss Federal statistics, more than double of the accidents have occurred in the Seelisberg Tunnel than the Gotthard Tunnel. Furthermore, since the death toll in both tunnels seems to be comparable by federal statistics which indicate a death toll of one death per 104 million vehicles kilometers in the Saint Gotthard Tunnel as opposed to one death per 111 million vehicles kilometers in the Seelisberg tunnel, this measure cannot be justified on the basis of safety. To this date it might be worth noticing that there is no split traffic road tunnel that crosses the European alps.",transportation,10

"Kukushka (Georgian: ბაკურიანი-ბორჯომი რკინიგზა \""კუკუშკა\"") is a railroad between Borjomi and Bakuriani in Georgia, Eurasia. The construction of this 900 mm (2 ft 11 7⁄16 in) narrow gauge line began in 1897 and because of the difficult environmental conditions, lasted for four years. Since January 1902, the first \""Kukushka” train passed Borjomi-Bakuriani narrow-gauge line. Since then the \""Kukushka” serves tourists and the fans of skiing. For the movement to high-mountainous areas, a steam engine of \""Porter\"" type was brought from England. Cars of open type were added to the train, which were framed only by handrails. Since 1967, the small-steam engine was replaced by an electric engine from Škoda Transportation, Czechoslovakia. The operator of this line is “Borjom-Bakuriani Railway” LLC (BBR), the company was established in April 2010. The only Shareholder is “Railway Property Management” LLC, which itself is owned by Georgian Railway. The line is mainly used for passenger service.

"The Barcelona–Vallès Line (Catalan: Línia Barcelona-Vallès) is an unconnected standard gauge railway line linking Barcelona with Sabadell and Terrassa via the Collserola mountain range, in Catalonia, Spain. Its name refers to the Catalan historical region of Vallès, whereby most part of the line runs. Plaça de Catalunya station serves as the Barcelona terminus of the line, where almost all its trains either start or terminate. The line then continues northwards and branches off twice before leaving the city limits. Its main route splits in two in Sant Cugat del Vallès, forming two major branches to Sabadell and Terrassa. It has 34 passenger stations in operation and a total line length of 48.1 kilometres (29.9 mi). The origins of the line date from 1863, when a privately owned railway from Barcelona to the then-separated town of Sarrià was opened. In 1912, Catalan engineer Carles Emili Montañès created the company Ferrocarriles de Cataluña (FCC) in order to take control of the line and extend it northwards. After successive extensions, the line reached Terrassa and Sabadell in 1919 and 1922, respectively. In 1977, FCC announced that the whole line was to be closed due to the company's bad economic results. Nevertheless, the Spanish government prevented that from happening by taking control of it. The line was transferred to the Catalan government in 1979, and has been operated by Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) ever since. Currently, the most prominent intervention on the line is the extension of the Terrassa and Sabadell branches through the construction of a route underneath the two cities; the former was completed in 2015, whilst the latter will do so in 2017. Barcelona Metro rapid transit lines 6, 7 and 12 serve the line's urban branches within Barcelona, while the rest of the line is operated as a high-frequency commuter rail system known as Vallès Metro (Catalan: Metro del Vallès). This system further includes the Vallvidrera Funicular, which is also operated by FGC.

Along with the Betsy Ross Bridge, the Benjamin Franklin Bridge and the Walt Whitman Bridge, the Commodore Barry Bridge is one of the four toll bridges connecting the metropolitan Philadelphia region with southern New Jersey owned by the Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA). Originally designed to connect with a now-cancelled freeway, the limited-access bridge has recently been retrofitted to better serve the local area. Between 2007 and 2011, both the DRPA and the PennDOT, in conjunction with the Chester Redevelopment Authority, built a pair of entrance-exit ramps that allowed motorists, primarily heavy truck traffic, to access the Chester Waterfront, via Pennsylvania Route 291 and Flower Street (via W. 9th Street (U.S. 13)) from I-95.

"Perrine's Bridge is the second oldest covered bridge in the State of New York, after the Hyde Hall Bridge in East Springfield. Once located in the hamlet called Perrines Bridge between 1850 and 1861. It is located in the modern day town of Esopus-Rosendale, New York just a few hundred feet to the east of Interstate 87 crossing of the Wallkill River in Ulster County, New York. Originally built to aid in the movement of trade between the towns of Rifton and Rosendale, the bridge is about 90 miles north of New York city between mile markers 81 and 82 on the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87). In May 1834 the State of New York authorized and provided money ($700) to Ulster county, NY (which invested $1500), to build the bridge. In 1835, the bridge was built by Benjamin Wood (b. 1780 d. 1838), the one-lane wooden covered bridge has been closed to vehicular traffic since 1930. The Bridge derives its name from James W. Perrine (b. 1780 d. 1849), a descendant of Daniel Perrin \""The Huguenot\"", who was a tavern keeper that opened an inn on the east side of that future bridge in 1820. Perrine's son was hired each winter as the \""snower\"". He would spread snow the length of the structure so horse-drawn sleighs could cross. It was declared as a New York Historical site in 1966 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places as of April 13, 1973. It has been restored many times, the last in 1997 at a cost of $195,000.",transportation,10

"(For the road from Enniskillen to the border with the Republic of Ireland, see A509 road (Northern Ireland).) The A509 is a short A-class road (around 30 miles (48 km) long) for north-south journeys in south central England, forming the route from Kettering in Northamptonshire to the M1 and A5 in Milton Keynes. From north to south, the road begins at Wicksteed Park in the outskirts of Kettering. It then crosses the A14 (where it becomes a primary route) and goes through Isham and Great Harrowden. After this it goes on to form the Wellingborough western bypass before leaving Northamptonshire to cross into the Borough of Milton Keynes (ceremonial Buckinghamshire). From there, it crosses the A428 at a roundabout and cuts through the centre of Olney. South of Olney the road passes Emberton, meeting the A422 just east of Newport Pagnell, where the routes multiplex to form the Newport Pagnell eastern bypass. South of Newport Pagnell, the routes diverge at a roundabout with the A509 turning south and the A422 continuing westbound. Here the A509 is a single carriageway once more until it crosses the M1 at Junction 14, where it enters Milton Keynes proper and multiplexes for a short distance with the A4146 (on separating, the latter takes over the 'primary route' designation and the A509 loses it). Once more a dual carriageway, it runs for a further 4 miles (6.4 km) past the edge of Central Milton Keynes (the central business district) and the Network Rail National Centre ('Quadrant:MK'), to link up finally with the A5.

"The Queen Creek Tunnel is a 1,217 feet (371 m) long tunnel on US 60 in the Superstition Mountains, just east of Superior, Arizona. Completed in 1952, the Queen Creek Tunnel links Phoenix with Safford by way of Superior and Globe/Miami. It replaced the smaller Claypool Tunnel that has been built in 1926. The new tunnel was cut through the solid rock of the Queen Creek gorge, approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) from the 4,625 feet (1,410 m) mountain summit.. It is 22 feet (6.7 m) in height and 42 feet (13 m) wide at its base. The cost of the tunnel at the time of its construction was $550,000 and was built by the Fischer Contracting Company. At the 1952 dedication ceremony, a drill rig used in boring the tunnel was the used a platform for the speakers, other officials, and a brass band. The completion of the tunnel was the final part of a Arizona Highway Department program begun in 1937 to improve the original approximately 20 miles (32 km) section of US 60 between Superior and Miami that was constructed in 1920-22. The roadbed in the tunnel climbs at a 6% grade, and the original lighting was insufficient to allow motorists good depth perception. The original lighting was improved with the installation of fluorescent lights in the 1960s.. Assistance in design of the new lighting was given by Arizona Public Service and the California Division of Highways. In October 2016, the tunnel lighting system was upgraded to light-emitting diode (LED) technology. It was the first tunnel in Arizona to get LEDs. The lighting system system adjusts the lighting level based upon ambient light and weather conditions outside with an adaptive control system. The system offers improved visibility, reduced energy consumption, and lower maintenance. ADOT plans to eventually widen US 60 in the area and may bypass the tunnel to avoid the impact of such a project on an environmentally sensitive canyon.

"The Ironton–Russell Bridge opened in 1922 as the first highway bridge along the Ohio River between Ironton, Ohio and Russell, Kentucky. Soon, the Ironton-Russell bridge was followed by numerous others at Ashland, Portsmouth, and Huntington. This light-blue cantilever bridge carries two lanes of traffic and a narrow sidewalk (which is currently closed to pedestrian traffic). In 2000, the Ohio Department of Transportation released a report recommended the replacement of the then 78-year-old span. The bridge was retrofitted in the 1970s with strengthening beams and plates. Later inspection of the bridge revealed that these plates had been welded to the bridge using techniques that violated the bridge welding codes and reduced the fatigue strength of primary load members. As a result of these findings, ODOT added reinforcements to some vertical members to improve structural redundancy. The bridge will still be forced to close when temperatures approach -5 degrees Fahrenheit due to the brittle nature of the steel used. Continuous monitoring is routine during temperatures below freezing to check for any cracking in the substructure of the span. In addition, in May 2008, ODOT placed a width restriction on the bridge, banning all vehicles that are wider than 7 ft. 6 in. Emergency vehicles, non-commercial vehicles and non-profit buses (such as school buses) are exempt from the restriction. ODOT has authorized both the Ironton and Russell city police, along with the Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Kentucky State Police, to enforce the restriction. Also, depending on the agency issuing the citation, volators may be cited in either the Ironton Municipal Court in Ohio or the Greenup County District Court in Kentucky. One of the replacements considered was a three-lane single-tower cable suspension bridge. The final design was chosen in January 2003, however, the high costs of constructing the bridge became apparent when costs for the new bridge came in at $110 million, well over the original estimated cost. The sharp rise was attributed to the dramatic increase in construction costs partially blamed on Hurricane Katrina, which increased the cost of concrete materials and items derived from petroleum products. The bridge has been redesigned as a two tower cable-stayed bridge and has been reduced from three lanes to two. Construction on the replacement span began in March 2012 just upstream from the current structure. The current bridge will remain open during construction and will be closed and demolished once the new bridge is open.",transportation,10

"The Leonard P. Zakim (/ˈzeɪkəm/) Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge (or Zakim Bridge) is a cable-stayed bridge across the Charles River in Boston, Massachusetts. It is a replacement for the Charlestown High Bridge, an older truss bridge constructed in the 1950s. Of ten lanes, using the harp-style system of nearly-parallel cable layout, coupled with the use of \""cradles\"" through each pylon for the cables, the main portion of the Zakim Bridge carries four lanes each way (northbound and southbound) of the Interstate 93 and U.S. Route 1 concurrency between the Thomas P. \""Tip\"" O'Neill Jr. Tunnel and the elevated highway to the north. Two additional lanes are cantilevered outside the cables, which carry northbound traffic from the Sumner Tunnel and North End on-ramp. These lanes merge with the main highway north of the bridge. I-93 heads toward New Hampshire as the \""Northern Expressway\"", and US 1 splits from the Interstate and travels northeast toward Massachusetts' North Shore communities, crossing the Mystic River via the Tobin Bridge.

"The Subway (formerly known as the inter-terminal train) at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, (IAH) is the older of the two separate inter-terminal people movers operating at the airport. Opened with the airport, the train system was replaced in 1981 with the current WEDway system, a people mover system built by WED Transportation Systems, a division of what is now known as Walt Disney Imagineering. The Subway serves landside traffic, unlike the newer Skyway which operates airside. The Subway is the only WEDway people mover built by the Walt Disney Company outside of a Disney property. It uses much of the mechanical technology used by the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover, an attraction in the Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland. The design permits the trains to make tight corners that are necessary along portions of the basement route, and is unusual in that on-train station announcements and audible warning messages are actually provided by a trackside audio system through openings in the tops of the vehicle carbodies. The train operates in a circuit, stopping at every terminal as well as the Houston Airport Hotel before returning to its starting point.

"Interstate 12 (I-12) is an Interstate Highway located entirely within the U.S. state of Louisiana. It spans a total of 85.59 miles (137.74 km) in an east–west direction from I-10 in Baton Rouge to an interchange with both I-10 and I-59 in Slidell. Along the way, it passes through the city of Hammond, where it intersects I-55 and US 51. It also serves the smaller cities of Denham Springs and Ponchatoula, as well as the St. Tammany Parish cities of Covington and Mandeville. Skirting the northern shore of Lake Pontchartrain, I-12 serves as a northern bypass of the New Orleans metropolitan area and as an alternate route for I-10, which serves the city of New Orleans itself. I-12 parallels the older US 190 corridor and traverses the North Shore of Lake Pontchartrain in the southeastern portion of the state. The interstate's length is short for a mainline interstate and is comparable with the country's longest auxiliary interstates. It is one of the shortest mainline interstates to terminate at the same route (I-10) at either end. Apart from serving the various communities of the North Shore, I-12 acts as a long bypass of New Orleans and is heavily used as a shortcut for through traffic on I-10. While I-10 curves to the south to pass through the city limits, I-12 takes a more direct alignment, reducing the distance between Baton Rouge and Slidell by about 22 miles (35 km). In 1993, the Louisiana state legislature designated I-12 as the Republic of West Florida Parkway. In 2003, signs identifying the highway's official name and bearing the flag of the Republic of West Florida were erected by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LADOTD) in order to highlight the unique history of Louisiana's Florida Parishes. Louisiana is in the process of widening I-12 to three lanes in locations where the interstate is still two lanes in each direction.",transportation,10

It extends for 62.35 miles (100.34 km) from an intersection with NY 13, NY 34, and NY 96 in the Tompkins County city of Ithaca to an interchange with NY 104 in the Wayne County town of Wolcott. The route spans a total of three counties, connecting the heart of the Finger Lakes Region to a point 6 miles (10 km) south of Lake Ontario. Along the way, NY 89 intersects two regionally important highways: the conjoined routes of U.S. Route 20 (US 20) and NY 5 in Seneca Falls and NY 31 in Savannah. NY 89 runs along the western edge of Cayuga Lake from Ithaca to Seneca Falls. NY 89 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to a significantly different alignment than it follows today. At the time, the route began in Varick and passed through Seneca Falls and Clyde before ending near North Rose. It was extended south to Ithaca c. 1933 and rerouted north of Seneca Falls in the late 1950s to serve Savannah and Wolcott instead. The latter change supplanted part of NY 414, which was subsequently moved onto NY 89's original routing from Seneca Falls to North Rose.

"The First Hannibal Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Missouri River and was to establish Kansas City, Missouri as a major city and rail center. Construction started in 1867, shortly after the end of the American Civil War. Construction on the bridge was completed in 1869. The completion of the bridge came after a short battle between Leavenworth, Kansas and the town of Kansas City for the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad bridge. After construction was completed, the population of Kansas City began to boom. It was designed by Octave Chanute, who also designed the Kansas City Stockyards. It was a swing bridge which could open in under two minutes, and it had an arched truss design. The bridge cost $1 million to build in its day. The bridge was built for the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad by Keystone Bridge Company. Although the railroad became part of the BNSF Railway, the name \""Hannibal\"" has stuck. In 1886, the bridge was severely damaged by a tornado which collapsed a middle span. It was reconstructed and its truss structure was altered from an arch design to a traditional truss design. It was later replaced by the Second Hannibal Bridge 200 feet upstream on the northern bank, but at the same location on the southern bank where it enters into the gooseneck cut into the bluff, where it still stands today.",transportation,10

"New York State Route 332 (NY 332) is a north–south state highway that extends for 9.05 miles (14.56 km) through Ontario County in the Finger Lakes region of New York in the United States. The southern terminus of the route is at an intersection with U.S. Route 20 (US 20), NY 5, and NY 21 just south of downtown Canandaigua. Its northern terminus is located at the toll barrier preceding New York State Thruway (Interstate 90 or I-90) exit 44 in Farmington. NY 332 is the primary route for travelers destined for Canandaigua from locales such as Rochester and Victor to the northwest of the city. Within the Canandaigua city limits, NY 332 is Main Street, a major arterial through downtown lined with numerous shops, stores and points of interest. At the city line, the route becomes Rochester Road and the surroundings become more rural, with the number of businesses continually decreasing to where no structures are present on the road. Farther north in Farmington, a small cluster of establishments centered on the intersection with NY 96 represents the last major commercial location on NY 332 before it ends at the Thruway. The route is four lanes wide along its entire length. NY 332 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, originally beginning at West Avenue (then part of US 20 and NY 5) in Canandaigua and ending at NY 96 in Farmington. The route was extended north to meet the New York State Thruway in 1954 and extended south to its current terminus following the completion of the Western Bypass around Canandaigua in the late 1970s and early 1980s.",transportation,10
"Valmorea railway is a railway line in Lombardy, Italy. Originally built as Olona Valley railway, to serve the industrial complexes of this region, it was later prolonged until the Swiss border by Valmorea, reached in 1926, where it continued as the Mendrisio–Stabio railway. But only two years later the border crossing was closed by the Italian government, which didn't agree with a privately owned international connection (the Italian section of the line was operated by Ferrovie Nord Milano). The passenger traffic was suspended and the line was used only for internal freight traffic until 1977. Since 1993 the line has been rebuilt from the Swiss side as a touristic line. The current terminus is Malnate Olona, but there are plans to reach Castiglione Olona.",transportation,10

The line is also known as the IRT East Side Line, as it is currently the only line in Manhattan to directly serve the Upper East Side and East Midtown; this four-track line is the most used rapid transit line in the United States. Its average of 1.3 million daily riders is \""more than the combined ridership of San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston’s entire transit systems.\"" Its ridership also exceeds that of the 798,456 daily trips on the entire Washington Metro, and in part spurred the construction of the Second Avenue Subway starting in 2007. Four stations along this line have been abandoned. When platforms were lengthened to fit ten cars, it was deemed most beneficial to close these stations and open new entrances for adjacent stations. The 18th Street station was abandoned because of the proximity to both 14th Street–Union Square and 23rd Street. In addition, the Worth Street and City Hall stations are both very close to the Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall station's Brooklyn Bridge and Duane Street exits, respectively, so both were abandoned.

"The Kennedy Highway is a highway in northern Queensland, Australia. It runs as National Route 1 for approximately 243 km from Smithfield, on the northern outskirts of Cairns, to the Gulf Developmental Road in the vicinity of Forty Mile Scrub and Undara Volcanic national parks (about 40 kilometres south of Mount Garnet). South of this junction, the road continues as the Kennedy Developmental Road (State Highway 62) to Boulia about 936 kilometres away, via Hughenden. West of the junction, National Route 1 continues as the Gulf Developmental Road to Normanton. From Smithfield, the highway climbs up into the Atherton Tableland before heading in a general south-westerly direction to the aforementioned junction. The highway is mostly two-lanes. Major towns on, or just off, the Kennedy Highway include Smithfield, Kuranda, Mareeba, Atherton, Ravenshoe and Mount Garnet. Past Mount Garnet, the Kennedy Highway has several long sections of single lane bitumen. The section between The Lynd junction and Hughenden is mostly unsealed and is also known as the Hann Highway. For a distance of more than 100 km, from the crossing on the Diamantina River to a point southwest of Middleton, the Kennedy Developmental Road passes across a roughly circular zone measuring some 130 km across that has been identified by Geoscience Australia as a crustal anomaly. Proof is currently lacking as to the cause, but it is believed likely that the anomaly was caused by an asteroid strike that happened about 300,000,000 years ago. Two northern councils are proposing development of the Hann Highway which would allow for the transport of products from Far North Queensland to markets in New South Wales and Victoria considerably quicker than via existing coastal routes which have rougher terrain and are sometimes impassable due to floods.",transportation,10
"The Fire Island Inlet Bridge, an integral part of the Robert Moses Causeway, is a two-lane, steel arch span with a concrete deck that carries the parkway over Fire Island Inlet. Construction of the Fire Island Bridge was completed in 1964 and although a relatively young structure, (less than 50 years old), its concrete deck has suffered from severe chloride ingress resulting in cracks, spalling, and the formation of potholes. The Fire Island Inlet span of the Robert Moses Causeway connects to Robert Moses State Park on the western tip of Fire Island. The Fire Island Inlet Bridge is located south of the State Boat Channel Bridge, a 665-foot (203 m) long bascule bridge modeled after Brooklyn's Mill Basin Drawbridge. The Fire Island Inlet span cost $10 million to complete and opened to traffic on June 13, 1964. By 1985, a dual span was supposed to be built to alleviate traffic; the second bridge proposal was never implemented.As first proposed in 1938, the span was to be a vertical-lift span with a design similar to that of the Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge. The design was changed to conform with that of the Great South Bay Bridge, a 600-foot (180 m) steel-arch span with a 60-foot (18 m) clearance. In 2004, the New York State Department of Transportation began studies on the Fire Island Inlet span after the realization that it was rapidly decomposing due to flaws in the cement during its construction. A 5-short-ton (4,500 kg) weight restriction was enforced by local police until permanent repairs could be made. Currently repairs are being undertaken to extend the life and safety of the bridge; groundbreaking for a new bridge was expected in 2010. It is assumed that the new bridge will be built to the west of the current structure; the new span will be four lanes, two southbound and two northbound. The new Fire Island Bridge will keep the look of the old one for aesthetic conformity with the other bridges over the bay.",transportation,10
"The Eads Bridge is a steel technology combined road and railway bridge over the Mississippi River at St. Louis, connecting St. Louis and East St. Louis, Illinois. Opened in 1874, it was one of the earliest long bridges built across the Mississippi, the world' first all steel construction, and built high enough so steamboats could travel under. As such, the St. Louis Landmark is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, as a U.S. National Historic Landmark. As of April 2014, it carries about 8,100 vehicles daily, down 3,000 since the new Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge opened in February 2014. The bridge is named for its designer and builder, James B. Eads. When completed in 1874, the Eads Bridge was the longest arch bridge in the world, with an overall length of 6,442 feet (1,964 m). The ribbed steel arch spans were considered daring, as was the use of steel as a primary structural material: it was the first such use of true steel in a major bridge project. The cost of building the bridge was nearly ten million dollars. The Eads Bridge was also the first bridge to be built using cantilever support methods exclusively, and one of the first to make use of pneumatic caissons. The Eads Bridge caissons, still among the deepest ever sunk, were responsible for one of the first major outbreaks of \""caisson disease\"" (also known as \""the bends\"" or decompression sickness). Fifteen workers died, two other workers were permanently disabled, and 77 were severely afflicted. On June 14, 1874, John Robinson led a \""test elephant\"" on a stroll across the new Eads Bridge to prove it was safe. A big crowd cheered as the elephant from a traveling circus lumbered towards Illinois. It was believed that elephants had instincts that would keep them from setting foot on unsafe structures. Two weeks later, Eads sent 14 locomotives back and forth across the bridge at one time. The opening day celebration on July 4, 1874 featured a parade that stretched fifteen miles through the streets of St. Louis. The Eads Bridge, which became an iconic image of the city of St. Louis, from the time of its erection until 1965 when the Gateway Arch was constructed, is still in use. The bridge crosses the St. Louis riverfront between Laclede's Landing, to the north, and the grounds of the Gateway Arch, to the south. Today the road deck has been restored, allowing vehicular and pedestrian traffic to cross the river. The St. Louis MetroLink light rail system has used the rail deck since 1993.",transportation,10

"Interstate 895 (I-895) is an Interstate Highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known as the Harbor Tunnel Thruway, the highway runs 14.87 miles (23.93 km) between one junction with I-95 in Elkridge and another interchange with I-95 on the east side of Baltimore. I-895 is a toll road that crosses the Patapsco River estuary via the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, connecting U.S. Route 1 (US 1), I-695, and the Baltimore–Washington Parkway in the southwestern suburbs of Baltimore with US 40 on the east side of Baltimore. In conjunction with a pair of spurs, unsigned , I-895 provides access to the tunnel from I-97 and Maryland Route 2 (MD 2) in Glen Burnie. The highway is designed for through traffic by having partial interchanges that require vehicles from almost all starting points to pass through the tunnel and the tunnel toll plaza, where a $4 toll is charged to passenger vehicles, before exiting the facility. The idea of a crossing of the Patapsco River south of downtown Baltimore has been studied since the 1930s. In the early 1950s, the Maryland State Roads Commission chose to construct a four-lane tunnel between the Canton and Fairfield neighborhoods of Baltimore and approach highways to connect the tunnel with major highways to Washington, Annapolis, Richmond, and Philadelphia. The tunnel and approach highways were constructed beginning in 1955 and opened in November 1957, opening a bottleneck for Baltimore through traffic, which formerly had to navigate the city streets. The Harbor Tunnel Thruway was connected with the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway in the early 1960s and the portion of I-95 south to Washington in the early 1970s. With these connections, I-895 was burdened with most of the through traffic passing through Baltimore. The congestion was not resolved until I-95 through Baltimore was completed when the eight-lane Fort McHenry Tunnel opened in November 1985. The transfer of most traffic to the new tunnel allowed the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel to be partially shut down for extensive maintenance in the late 1980s.",transportation,10

"(This article is about the section of U.S. Route 15 in Maryland. For the entire route, see U.S. Route 15.) U.S. Route 15 (US 15) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from Walterboro, South Carolina to Painted Post, New York. In Maryland, the highway runs 37.85 miles (60.91 km) from the Virginia state line at the Potomac River in Point of Rocks north to the Pennsylvania state line near Emmitsburg. Known for most of its length as Catoctin Mountain Highway, US 15 is the primary north–south highway of Frederick County. The highway connects the county seat of Frederick with Point of Rocks, Leesburg, Virginia, and Charles Town, West Virginia (via US 340), to the south and with Thurmont, Emmitsburg, and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to the north. US 15 is a four-lane divided highway throughout the state except for the portion between the Point of Rocks Bridge and the highway's junction with US 340 near Jefferson. The U.S. Highway is a freeway along its concurrency with US 340 and through Frederick, where the highway meets US 40 and Interstate 70 (I-70). US 15 has an unsigned  through Emmitsburg. US 15 is the descendent of a pair of turnpikes that connected Frederick with Emmitsburg to the north and Buckeystown to the south. These turnpikes were reconstructed as state roads in the 1910s north of Frederick and in the early 1920s from Frederick south to Tuscarora. When US 15 was assigned in 1927, the Tuscarora – Point of Rocks highway had yet to be improved; this section was paved in the early 1930s. The modern Point of Rocks Bridge was built in the late 1930s after its predecessor was destroyed in a flood. The Frederick Freeway was constructed in the 1950s. US 15 was relocated to part of the freeway; the old route of the U.S. Highway through downtown Frederick became part of Maryland Route 355 (MD 355). US 15's present highway between Point of Rocks and Jefferson was constructed in the late 1960s; the old road south of Frederick was replaced with MD 28 and MD 85. North of Frederick, the U.S. Highway bypassed Thurmont and Emmitsburg in the late 1950s and mid-1960s, respectively.

It includes the westernmost part of China National Highway 318 (Shanghai-Zhangmu) and crosses three passes over 5,000m before dropping to 1,750m at the border. The 2015 Earthquakes in the region closed the highway and caused many evacutaions. By 2016 there was some repairs but trading on the route was not restored to pre-quake levels. From Lhasa, the Friendship Highway follows the Kyi Chu river for about 60 km up to the confluence with the Yarlung Tsangpo River (Brahmaputra) at Chushul. The main route continues along the Yarlung valley up to Shigatse, Tibet's second-largest city and formerly the home of the Panchen Lamas. A subsidiary branch crosses the Yarlung Tsangpo at Chushul and crosses the 4,800m high Gampa La, passes along turquoise Yamdrok Yutso lake before crossing the 5,045m high Karo La at the foot of Noijin Kangsang, and following downstream the Nyang Chu valley through Gyantse up to Shigatse.

It is being consturcted by the Fort Worth Transportation Authority (\""The T\"") and is scheduled to open in 2018. The new line is expected to cost $330 million, of which 10 percent would be Grapevine's share. This segment of the Cotton Belt Rail Line will be operated independent of the other two segments, as it is being built by the T, instead of DART, who will be building the other segments. Officials with the T are hoping the new rail line will entice non-T member cities along the line to join the transit agency in its quest to become a regional transit entity. Cities along the route include Colleyville, Haltom City and North Richland Hills. The route also goes through small parts of Hurst and Southlake.

"Bundesautobahn 61 (translates from German as Federal Motorway 61, short form Autobahn 61, abbreviated as BAB 61 or A 61) is an autobahn in Germany that connects the border to the Netherlands near Venlo in the northwest to the interchange with A 6 near Hockenheim. In 1965, this required a redesign of the Hockenheimring. The autobahn runs parallel to the A 3 on the opposite side of the Rhine. Between Mönchengladbach and Bergheim in the north and Worms, Ludwigshafen and Speyer in the south, it cuts through the landscapes of Eifel and Hunsrück, avoiding areas of dense population while still in proximity to Cologne, Bonn, Koblenz and Bingen. The A 61, built in the 1970s, is the most western connection from the Netherlands and Belgium to southern Germany so many trucks and tourists from these countries frequent the A 61. Between Kreuz Mönchengladbach and Wanlo, the speed limit is 120 km/h. The section between the junctions Wanlo and Jackerath was upgraded to three lanes in 2005. The speed limit there is 130 km/h, paid for by RWE Power that in return received permission to close a section of A 44 for their Garzweiler surface mining operation. By 2017, the A 44 will be restored and the Wanlo-Jackerath-section of the A 61 will be closed instead. Between Dreieck Erfttal and Kreuz Bliesheim the A1 and A61 run concurrently. The motorway has three lanes each way and a variable speed limit here. Since 4 April 2012, the A61 continues into the Netherlands as A74. This short motorway connects the A61 at the border with the Dutch A73. Previously, all traffic had to go through the city of Venlo.

"The South Market Street Bridge, officially the Senator John E. Reilly, Sr. Bridge, is a bascule bridge that spans the Christina River in Wilmington, Delaware. The current bridge, opened in 1927, is the latest of many bridges that have spanned the Christina at this location since 1808 when the first wooden turn bridge was constructed. Its construction was administered by the then State Highway Department (predecessor of the Delaware Department of Transportation), and was built to replace the swing bridge that was built in 1883 to replace the wooden turn bridge built in 1808. The span is one of only three pre-1957 drawbridges of its type in Delaware. In 1982, the bridge was named after Wilmington state Senator John Edward Reilly Sr., a gravel-voiced cigar smoker known for his warmth and wit, died of cancer Feb. 26, 1963. The bridge underwent a major rehabilitation in 2004-2006 to replace and upgrade the existing machinery and improve lighting, pedestrian walkways, and the operator towers.",transportation,10
"European route E 33 is a series of roads in Italy, part of the United Nations International E-road network. It runs from Parma to La Spezia, both in Italy. It leaves Parma, where it links to E 35 and heads south-west, reaching its destination of La Spezia, where it further links to E 80, a transcontinental route. The is therefore exactly the same route as the Italian A15. In practice, the number E 33 does not appear on any road signs. Instead, its entire stretch is signposted as E 31, creating a duplication with the E 31 in Germany and the Netherlands. This goes back to the numbering set forth in the original European Agreement on Main International Traffic Arteries (AGR) of 1975, in which Parma - La Spezia was numbered E 31 and Rotterdam - Ludwigshafen was numbered E 33. These numbers were swapped upon the AGR's entry into force in 1985, apparently resulting from the fact that the Parma - La Spezia route is entirely situated east of the Rotterdam - Ludwigshafen route so that the former should under AGR principles have a number above the former. This numbering change, however, never made it onto Italian signs.",transportation,10
"Tonkin Highway is a 44-kilometre-long (27 mi) north-south highway in Perth, Western Australia, linking Perth Airport and Kewdale with the city's north-eastern and south-eastern suburbs. The northern terminus is at Reid Highway in Malaga, and the southern terminus is at Thomas Road in Oakford. It forms the entire length of State Route 4, and connects to several major roads, including Great Eastern Highway, Leach Highway, Roe Highway, and Albany Highway. Planning for the route began in the 1950s, but the first segment between Wattle Grove and Cloverdale was not opened until 1980. Over the next five years, the highway was extended north to Great Eastern Highway and south to Albany Highway, and a discontinuous section was constructed north of the Swan River. In 1988 the Redcliffe Bridge linked these sections, and three years later, Reid Highway became the northern terminus. The next major works on the highway, between 2003 and 2005, extended the highway south to Thomas Road. The Gateway WA project plans to improve the road network around Perth Airport, including upgrading the central section of Tonkin Highway to a six-lane freeway-standard road. Construction began in 2013, and completion is scheduled for 2017.

At both ends, PA 462 terminates at U.S. Route 30 (US 30), which follows a freeway alignment parallel to the north between York and Lancaster. The route heads east into York, where it follows the one-way pair of Market Street eastbound and Philadelphia Street westbound. In York, PA 462 runs concurrent with PA 74 and crosses Interstate 83 Business (I-83 Bus.). East of York, the route becomes a multilane road and has an interchange with I-83 and crosses PA 24. PA 462 continues east to through Hallam to Wrightsville and passes through that town before it crosses the Susquehanna River and runs through Columbia. East of here, the route continues through Mountville before reaching the city of Lancaster. In Lancaster, PA 462 is routed on the one-way pair of King Street eastbound and West Walnut Street, with the westbound direction concurrent with PA 23. The route crosses US 222/PA 272 and northbound PA 72 in Lancaster. East of Lancaster, PA 462 becomes a multilane road again and continues to its eastern terminus. The section of the current route east of Lancaster was built as a turnpike called the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike in 1794, which headed east to Philadelphia. By 1796, a road continued west from Lancaster across the Susquehanna River to York. The state took over the turnpike in the beginning of the 20th century. In 1913, the road between York and Lancaster was incorporated into the Lincoln Highway, an auto trail that ran from San Francisco to New York City. The Lincoln Highway through Pennsylvania became PA 1 in 1924. US 30 was designated concurrent with PA 1 west of Philadelphia in 1926, with the PA 1 designation removed two years later. US 30 was widened into a multilane road between York and Lancaster in the 1930s. The route was moved to one-way pairs in Lancaster in the 1930s, following King Street eastbound and Orange Street westbound, and York in the 1950s, following Market Street eastbound and Philadelphia Street westbound. In 1967, US 30 was moved to a freeway bypass between Prospect Road east of Columbia and east of Lancaster, with the former alignment becoming PA 462.

It formed a semicircle through the inner suburbs of Rochester, following expressways west and east of the city and surface streets south of Rochester. The western terminus of the route was at an interchange with NY 104 west of the city limits in Greece. The eastern terminus was at an intersection with Culver Road in Irondequoit mere yards from Lake Ontario. In between its western and eastern extents, NY 47 met Interstate 490 (I-490) twice. The limited-access highway portions of the route were known as the Rochester Outer Loop (or Outer Loop) in contrast to the Inner Loop around downtown Rochester. NY 47 was originally routed along surface streets through the city when it was assigned c. 1937. It began at NY 31 in Gates and followed Howard Road and Brooks Avenue southeast into Rochester, where it continued eastward on Genesee Park Boulevard and Elmwood Avenue. NY 47 remained on the latter through Brighton to an area known as Twelve Corners. At this point, the route turned north onto Winton Road and followed that street through the eastern fringe of the city to Irondequoit, where NY 47 ended at a junction with U.S. Route 104 (US 104, now NY 404).

"The International Journal of Central Banking (IJCB) is an economic research journal which began in the 2004 decision of several Central Banks to create a professional journal for policymakers and researchers in the field of monetary policy. In July 2004, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the European Central Bank, and each of the Group of Ten (G-10) central banks announced their plans to support the development of a new publication focused on central bank theory and practice. Other central banks were invited to participate in this joint project, and there are now some 50 sponsoring institutions. The primary objectives of the IJCB are to widely disseminate the best policy-relevant and applied research on central banking and to promote communication among researchers both inside and outside of central banks. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson Jr. first proposed the idea of such a journal and discussed the concept with several BIS colleagues and with Federal Reserve Board Governor Ben S.

"The Whig was a polemical American newspaper published and edited by William G. \""Parson\"" Brownlow (1805–1877) in the mid-nineteenth century. As its name implies, the paper's primary purpose was the promotion and defense of Whig Party political figures and ideals. In the years leading up to the Civil War, the Whig became the mouthpiece for East Tennessee's anti-secessionist movement. The Whig was published under several names throughout its existence, namely the Tennessee Whig, the Jonesborough Whig, the Knoxville Whig, and similar variations. The Whig was one of the most influential newspapers in nineteenth-century Tennessee, due mainly to Brownlow's editorials, which often included vindictive personal attacks and fierce diatribes. A Methodist circuit rider by trade, Brownlow partnered with publisher Mason R. Lyon under a one year contract and launched the Whig on May 4, 1839 to counter rising Democratic sentiment in the region. He quickly made many enemies across the majority Democratic antebellum South. During his career, Brownlow survived several assassination attempts, numerous libel lawsuits, and arrest and imprisonment by Confederate authorities during the American Civil War. Brownlow's Whig editorials attacked Democrats and Methodism's two main competitors in East Tennessee: Baptists and Presbyterians. Brownlow also attacked groups who he believed supported Democrats, such as Catholics, Mormons, and immigrants. In spite of its anti-secessionist sentiments, the Whig was staunchly pro-slavery in the early days of the Civil War but, upon Brownlow's return from exile in 1863, the paper adopted an abolitionist stance. After Brownlow was elected governor in 1865, his son became publisher of the Whig. In 1870, Whig reporter William Rule (1839–1928) launched the Knoxville Chronicle (later renamed Knoxville Journal), which is often considered the \""successor\"" to the Whig.",history,5

"The Freeman's Journal was the oldest nationalist newspaper in Ireland. It was founded in 1763 by Charles Lucas and was identified with radical 18th-century Protestant patriot politicians Henry Grattan and Henry Flood. This changed from 1784 when it passed to Francis Higgins (better known as the \""Sham Squire\"") and took a more pro-British and pro-administration view. In the 19th century it became more nationalist in tone, particularly under the control and inspiration of Sir John Gray (1815–75). The Journal, as it was widely known as, was the leading newspaper in Ireland throughout the 19th century. Contemporary sources record it being read to the largely illiterate population by priests and local teachers gathering in homes. It was mentioned in contemporary literature and was seen as symbolising Irish newspapers for most of its time. By the 1880s it had become the primary media supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell and the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP). It was challenged on all sides by rivals. On the nationalist side some preferred The Nation founded by Thomas Davis while others, including radical supporters of Parnell, read the United Irishman. The Anglo-Irish establishment in contrast read the historically Irish unionist The Irish Times. With the split in the IPP over Parnell's relationship with Katherine O'Shea, its readership split too. While The Journal went with the majority in 1893 in opposing Parnell, a minority moved to read the Daily Irish Independent. It was also challenged from the turn of the century by William O'Brien's Irish People and the Cork Free Press. With Thomas Sexton becoming Chairman of the Board of Directors (1893-1911), the Journal languished under his spartanic management. The collapse of the IPP in 1918, and the electoral success of Sinn Féin, saw a more radical nationalism appear that was out of step with the moderation of the Journal. It found itself overshadowed by the more aggressively marketed Irish Independent, the successor to the Daily Irish Independent. Just prior to the outbreak of the Irish Civil War in March 1922, the Freeman's Journal printing machinery was destroyed by Anti-Treaty IRA men under Rory O'Connor for its support of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. It did not resume publication until after the outbreak of civil war, when the Irish Free State re-asserted its authority over the country. The Freeman's Journal ceased publication in 1924, when it was merged with the Irish Independent. Until the 1990s, the Irish Independent included the words 'Incorporating the Freeman's Journal' in its mast-head over its editorials.",history,5

"La Razón is a local newspaper distributed in the public transportation system in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was founded in 1905 by Argentine journalist Emilio Morales an as an afternoon (Quinta edición) and evening (Sexta edición) newspaper in broadsheet format. The daily was acquired by a prominent news editor, José A. Cortejarena, in 1911 and became the first newspaper in Argentina owned by a journalist. Cortejarena died in 1921, and the paper was directed by Ángel L. Sojo, during whose tenure La Razón became known for scooping the city's numerous other papers. The daily also became the first to publish cartoonist Dante Quinterno's Patoruzú (an enduring Argentine comic strip) in 1928. La Razón was acquired by Ricardo Peralta Ramos, the scion of the founding family of seaside Mar del Plata, in 1939. Peralta Ramos named Félix Laiño director, and the paper's broadsheet layout was reformatted and more heavily illustrated. The paper grew steadily, and La Razón was expropriated in 1947 by order of President Juan Perón, whose populist leadership had become increasingly autocratic. Controlled by influential First Lady Eva Perón, the paper displaced longtime circulation leader La Nación by 1952, when its daily distribution reached 500,000 copies (Latin America's largest). The dictatorship that displaced Perón in 1955 initially resolved to retain the lucrative daily, but were challenged in court by the Peralta Ramos family; the legal case presented by their attorney, Marcos Satanowsky, made La Razón one of the few such publications returned to its rightful owners, as many were reportedly resold by the regime to pliant buyers. The paper inaugurated new printing installations in the pampas town of General Hornos, in 1964, and remained among the leading Argentine newspapers (second only to Clarín). Editor-in-chief Félix Laiño retired in 1984, and was replaced by former La Opinión publisher Jacobo Timerman, who had returned from exile in Israel, to where he fled after his abduction and torture by the last dictatorship, in 1977-79. Timerman downsized the ailing daily, and converted it into a morning paper, but a 1987 staff strike resulted in its closure. La Razón was then acquired by the Buenos Aires City Council. The insolvent publication was converted into a free-distribution evening daily in tabloid format, and can be found most commonly in train and subway stations, as well in as coffee shops in Buenos Aires.

"Emigre (ISSN 1045-3717) was a graphic design magazine published by Emigre Graphics between 1984 and 2005; it was first published in 1984 in San Francisco, California, United States. Art-directed by Rudy VanderLans using fonts designed by his wife, Zuzana Licko, Emigre was one of the first publications to use Macintosh computers and had a large influence on graphic designers moving into desktop publishing (DTP). Its variety of layouts, use of guest designers, and opinionated articles also had an effect on other design publications. The focus of Emigre was both redundant and wandering — both positive qualities as a journal produced by a tight and evolving group of designers and writers with Vanderlans at the center. Vanderlans was typically editor, though guest-editors also appeared (Gail Swanlund, Anne Burdick, Andrew Blauvelt) and the work/writing of Zuzana Licko and Jeffery Keedy reappeared throughout the magazine's history. The magazine began in 1984 with a focus on the émigré. The first eight issues were concerned with boundaries, international culture, travel accounts and alienation (as the issues' titles suggest). The first eight issues also incorporated a dynamic aesthetic that caught the attention of designers and led to the next stage in the magazine's evolution. Beginning with Issue 9 — devoted to the art of Vaughan Oliver at 4AD — the magazine explored design in itself, devoting issues to Cranbrook, the Macintosh, type design and individual graphic designers. In two issues in 1992 and 1993, the magazine chronicled the work of David Carson and Raygun. Increasingly, Emigre became a platform for essays and writings on design. This aspect of Emigre came to the forefront with issues in 1994 and the magazine changed its format in 1995 from its oversized layout to a text-friendlier format that debuted with Issue 33. The magazine retained this character through Issue 59 in 2001. Emigre then took a sharp turn with four re-formatted issues in 2001 and 2002 that included one DVD (\""Catfish,\"" an experimental documentary film on the work of designer and performance artist Elliott Earls) and three compact discs (featuring the music of Honey Barbara, The Grassy Knoll and Scenic. In its fifth and final incarnation, the last six issues of Emigre were co-published by Princeton Architectural Press as small softcover books. The last issue, The End, was published in 2005.",history,5

"L'Ordine Nuovo (Italian for \""The New Order\"") was a weekly newspaper established on May 1, 1919, in Turin, Italy, by a group, including Antonio Gramsci, Angelo Tasca and Palmiro Togliatti, within the Italian Socialist Party. The paper was the successor of La Città futura, a broadsheet newspaper. The founders of L'Ordine Nuovo were admirers of the Russian Revolution and strongly supported the immediate creation of soviets in Italy. They believed that existing factory councils of workers could be strengthened so that they could become the basis of a communist revolution. However, Amadeo Bordiga, who would become the founder of the Communist Party of Italy, criticised the plan as syndicalism, saying that soviets should only be created after Italy had come under communist control. Initially the newspaper, which was founded with union backing, focused on cultural politics, but in June 1919, the month following its founding, Gramsci and Togliatti pushed Tasca out and re-focused as a revolutionary voice. The newspaper reached a circulation of 6,000 by the end of the year and its reputation was heightened by its support of the April 1920 general strike, which the Socialist Party and the affiliated General Confederation of Labour did not support. On 1 January 1921 the paper began to be published on a daily basis. In January 1921, Bordiga and the supporters of L'Ordine Nuovo left the Socialist Party in order to establish the new Communist Party of Italy. The paper went defunct in 1922, to resume in March 1924 by publishing intermittently the last eight numbers until March 1925.",history,5

"The Evening Press was an Irish newspaper which was printed from 1954 until 1995. It was set up by Éamon de Valera's Irish Press group, and was originally edited by Douglas Gageby. Its principal competitor was the Evening Herald, which had been operating in Dublin as the one of only two evening papers since the demise of the Evening Telegraph in 1924. The Evening Press was an instant success, and contributed to the financial losses and eventual closure of the Evening Mail in 1962. The Evening Press heavily outsold the Evening Herald for most of its life also, particularly outside Dublin. It peaked at sales of 175,000 copies a day. The poor performance of The Irish Press, particularly after its unsuccessful relaunch in 1988, was a severe drain on the whole Irish Press Group, and probably damaged the Evening Press brand, although it continued to perform better in the evening newspaper market than its sister paper did in the morning market. It retained a loyal following due in part to the popularity of columnists such as sports writer Con Houlihan, although it struggled to generate advertising revenue. It also featured the world's most prolific cartoonist, Till (George O'Callaghan) who published nearly 10,000 cartoons in the paper between 1956 and 1992.

"The Baltimore Commercial Journal and Lyford's Price-Current was a weekly business newspaper published in Baltimore, Maryland, between 1840 and 1849. Printed by William G. Lyford, the paper was a revival of the defunct Baltimore Price Current. It was succeeded by the Baltimore Price-Current and Weekly Journal of Commerce. A price current is a business newspaper giving up-to-date prices of commodities and shipping news. The Baltimore Price-Current, predecessor of the Baltimore Commercial Journal and the first such publication in Baltimore, was founded by Joseph Escavaille, the proprietor of a coffeehouse (Baltimore Exchange Reading Rooms) serving shopkeepers and businessmen. The Price-Current was published from 1803 until shortly after Escavaille's death in 1828. It underwent several title changes, renamed the Baltimore Weekly Price Current in 1805 and the Baltimore Price Current in 1830. William G. Lyford revived the Price Current, now called Lyford's Price Current, on March 3, 1838. The paper was renamed Lyford's Baltimore Price Current in 1839 and the Baltimore Commercial Journal, and Lyford's Price-Current in 1840. Each issue of the newspaper was four pages long. Information published in the paper included shipping news (arrivals and departures of boats and trains), a marine list (passengers of ships entering and leaving Baltimore), and Port of Baltimore rules and regulations. Rates and prices included in the paper covered stocks, wholesale merchandise, postage, and data reprinted from other exchanges. The Commercial Journal also printed short reviews of markets for the previous week. Lyford retired from publishing in 1849 and sold the newspaper to George U. Porter and Thomas W. Tobin. Porter and Tobin began publishing the Baltimore Price-Current and Weekly Journal of Commerce on June 29, 1850. In 1882, an industrial news and intelligence section was added to the paper, which was renamed the Journal of Commerce and Manufacturers Record. The Journal and Record were split that same year and continued to be edited and published separately. The Journal of Commerce and Price-Current was sold to and subsumed by the Manufacturers Record upon Porter's death in summer 1886. The Record continued publication until 1928.",history,5

The newspaper recently featured in the 'Rotten Boroughs' section of Private Eye magazine after the Department for Communities and Local Government produced the whitepaper 'Guidance for local authorities on community cohesion contingency planning and tension monitoring'. The whitepaper revealed that: \""Tameside holds regular meetings with local newspaper editors to gather information and stop sensationalist reporting which might otherwise start or add to rising tensions, e.g. in response to a Kick Racism out of Football campaign, an extremist political group wanted to picket a local football stadium. A local newspaper was going to print the story on its front page – an action that was likely to bring unwanted publicity to the picket and fuel rising community tensions. The intervention of the Community Cohesion Partnership prevented the story from being run and in the event no-one turned out for the picket.\"" The editor was forced to respond to these allegations in Private Eye.

"This article is about the Irish website. For the U.S. magazine, see State Magazine. State.ie (formerly State Magazine) is an Irish website and formerly a monthly music magazine, which launched in April 2008 and ceased to print in January 2009 having published a total of ten issues. The magazine continues online and was voted Best Music Site in 2008 and Best Web Publication in 2010 in the Irish Web Awards. Originally the concept of the magazine involved a hard copy of which there was a charge to purchase, however after six issues it was decided to make the magazine's content free both online and in print. The first issue, April 2008, appeared on Irish shelves on 6 March 2008 and featured Michael Stipe of R.E.M. on the cover. This immediately garnered comparisons between the new magazine's similarities with Hot Press who featured Stipe on their cover at the same time, a move widely thought to be an attempt by Hot Press to stifle State's status as a serious 'alternative' to the more established local magazine. At a price of €5.50, State charged €2 more than Hot Press. State is published by Roger Woolman and edited by Hot Press alumni Phil Udell. Contributors include Evening Herald columnist, The Irish Times reviewer and blogger Sinead Gleeson, Rolling Stone writer Kara Manning, award-winning blogger Niall Byrne (a.k.a. Nialler9), Event Guide writer David O'Mahony and The Star feature writer Tanya Sweeney.

Tkach took over with major doctrinal transformation of the Worldwide Church of God, the circulation of The Plain Truth, distributed free by subscription and via newsstand distribution around the globe, fell from a peak of 8,000,000 to less than 100,000 before it switched to a paid subscription status. Eventually the magazine was spun off into a separate, independent, evangelical ministry as Plain Truth Ministries. The Plain Truth magazine as founded by H. W. Armstrong is no longer in print. However, two organizations, legally unrelated to each other or the original group, currently publish a magazine under the same name, one in the United Kingdom and one in the United States.",history,5

Its first editor was John Wesley Dafoe who came from the Winnipeg Free Press. In 1886, it was bought by Philip Dansken Ross. The paper began publishing a morning edition in 1917. In 1919, the paper's publishers bought the Ottawa Free Press. The former owner of that paper, E. Norman Smith, then became editor with Grattan O'Leary. In 1959, it was bought by F.P. Publications. By this time, the Journal, whose readers tended to come from rural areas, was trailing the Ottawa Citizen, its main competitor. The paper encountered labour problems during the 1970s and never really recovered. In 1980, it was bought by Thomson Newspapers and was closed on 27 August 1980. This left Southam Newspapers's Ottawa Citizen as the only major English language newspaper in Ottawa (Le Droit remaining the only French language daily newspaper in Ottawa). The closure aroused considerable controversy at the time, as a day later, Southam closed the Winnipeg Tribune, primary rival to Thomson's Winnipeg Free Press. Concern over these incidents prompted the federal government to conduct the Royal Commission on Newspapers, commonly known as the Kent Commission. To many, it seemed that possibly illegal collusion to reduce competition had occurred. Although charges were brought against both Southam and Thomson in April 1981 under the now-defunct Combines Investigation Act, alleging a breach of section 33 of that act, through merger or monopolistic conduct], they were dismissed on 9 December 1983.

"Benito Jacovitti (March 19, 1923 – December 3, 1997) was an Italian comic artist. Benito Jacovitti was born in Termoli, Molise. He was still a kid when he started drawing on the pavement of the village's streets. The son of a railwayman, Benito entered Macerata's art school at age 11, graduating to Firenze's art institute five years later. Here he received the nickname lisca di pesce (\""fishbone\"") because of his thin figure, that he will use as his signature during his career. In 1939 Jacovitti started working for the Florentine satirical magazine Il Brivido and, a year later, he began an almost 30 years long collaboration with Il Vittorioso, a Catholic comic magazine targeted at teenagers and young adults that only published Italian artists. There he created several characters: Pippo, Pertica e Palla, Oreste il guastafeste, Chicchiricchì, Cip l'arcipoliziotto and his nemesis Zagar, Giacinto corsaro dipinto, Jack Mandolino, La signora Carlomagno, adaptations of classic like Ali Baba and Don Quixote, and parodies of famous comics like L'onorevole Tarzan and Il mago Mandrago. During this period, he also contributed cartoons to the satirical weekly Il Travaso delle idee. Starting from 1949, Jacovitti produced a series of cartoons for school diaries, named I Diari Vitt (short for Vittorioso) and published by A.V.E. These books made him a household name among kids and parents, and he kept producing them until 1980. In 1956 he began working for the newspaper Il Giorno, then owned by Enrico Mattei, where he created his best known character, the cowboy Cocco Bill, as well as the private eye Tom Ficcanaso. Ten years later Jacovitti left Il Giorno to join the glorious Il Corriere dei Piccoli, then the most popular weekly publication for kids, for which he renewed old characters as Cip l'Arcipoliziotto and Zagar, and created new ones as Zorry Kid, Tarallino Tarallà and others. In 1973 he published the controversial Gionni Peppe on the left-wing oriented magazine Linus, followed in 1981 by Joe Balordo. Jacovitti's unique artstyle is immediately appealing to both kids and adults: his characters sport huge noses and feet, his pages are chock full of details and all sort of objects and weird creatures born from his untamed creativity (like his salami, often drawn with little legs or smiley faces). While most of his production was geared toward humour and parody, Jacovitti did not shy away from more controversial material like the erotic book Kamasutra and political cartoons. During his career, Jacovitti created more than 60 characters and produced around 150 books, making him one of the most prolific and original artists in comic book history.",art,0

His work is noted for its satire and parody of popular culture, social critique, and attention to detail. Kurtzman's working method has been likened to that of an auteur, and he expected those who illustrated his stories to follow his layouts strictly. Kurtzman began to work on the New Trend line of comic books at EC Comics' in 1950. He wrote and edited the Two-Fisted Tales and Frontline Combat war comic books, where he also drew many of the carefully researched stories, before he created his most-remembered comic book, Mad, in 1952. Kurtzman scripted the stories and had them drawn by top EC cartoonists, most frequently Will Elder, Wally Wood, and Jack Davis; the early Mad was noted for its social critique and parodies of pop culture. The comic book switched to a magazine format in 1955, and Kurtzman left it in 1956 over a dispute with EC's owner William Gaines over financial control. Following his departure, he did a variety of cartooning work, including editing the short-lived Trump and the self-published Humbug. In 1959, he produced the first book-length work of original comics, the adult-oriented, satirical Jungle Book. He edited the low-budget Help! from 1960 to 1965, a humor magazine which featured work by future Monty Python member Terry Gilliam and the earliest work of underground cartoonists such as Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton. He brought Help! to an end after the success of the risqué Playboy feature Little Annie Fanny began to take up his time.

From 1973, Kurtzman taught cartooning at the School of Visual Arts in New York. His work gained greater recognition toward the end of his life, and he oversaw deluxe reprintings of much of his work.

"John Engstead (22 September 1909 in California - 15 April 1983 in West Hollywood, California ) was an American photographer. Engstead began his career in 1926, when he was hired as an office boy by Paramount Pictures' head of studio publicity, Harold Harley. In 1927, Engstead pleased his boss by arranging a photo session for actress Clara Bow with photographer Otto Dyar using an outdoor setting which was unusual at that time. Engstead's creative direction of photographs of actress Louise Brooks led to a promotion to art supervisor, where he oversaw the production of Paramount's publicity stills. In 1932, due to a strike by photographers, Engstead assumed the position of studio portrait photographer, despite having never previously photographed anyone. Actor Cary Grant posed for his practice shots. He returned to his job as art supervisor after the strike was resolved. In 1941, Paramount Pictures fired Engstead, and Harper's Bazaar hired him for freelance advertising and portrait photography assignments. From 1941 to 1949, he took fashion photography assignments from numerous other magazines, including Collier's, Esquire, House Beautiful, Ladies Home Journal, Life, Look, Mademoiselle, McCall's, Vogue, and Women's Home Companion. In the 1940s, Engstead photographed many celebrities, including Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Maureen O'Hara and Shirley Temple. Unlike other photographers, he often shot his subjects at home or outdoors, and his portraits of Judy Garland in Carmel, California were particularly successful. During this decade, he built a studio in Los Angeles that became a gathering place for celebrities. Engstead continued to photograph movie stars and other celebrities through the 1950s (Marilyn Monroe) and 1960s. He produced promotional material for many television personalities, including Pat Boone, Carmel Quinn, Donna Reed, Ozzie and Harriet, Eve Arden, and Lucille Ball. He also shot cover photos for albums recorded by singers such as Peggy Lee and Connie Francis, as well as society portraits. His work extended into governmental figures in the 1950s, including then-Second Lady Pat Nixon. Engstead closed his studio in 1970 but continued to accept special portrait and television assignments until his death in 1984 at age 72.Engstead's images are represented by the Motion Picture and Television Photo Archive and can be viewed by the public at MPTV.net",art,0

He graduated from Queen's University Belfast in 1980 with a BA in French and Classical Greek. He taught French language for seventeen years at school. He worked the after-dinner comic entertainment circuit for many years, and he felt that his language background contributed to his voice-over impressions. During the Troubles, comedians needed to adopt a non-partisan stance, so his stage name was a neutral-sounding non-Catholic pseudonym. Sean Crummey was well known for his hilariously accurate depictions and his gentle, humorous political satire. He impersonated dozens of voices, particularly of Northern Ireland politicians. Some of Crummey's favourite voices to impersonate were the late PUP leader David Ervine, Pope John Paul II, and Bill McLaren. He also wrote and acted in Stormont, a stage play produced by Martin Lynch and directed by Michael Poynor, that ran at the Theatre at the Mill in Newtownabbey mid-September to early October 2010. On stage, Crummey alternately mimicked two politicians, Ulster Unionist Michael McGimpsey and Sinn Féin's Gerry Kelly. He died from a cancer-related illness just a day after his final show was broadcast. Politicians from across the political spectrum gave respectful tribute to his comic genius, penetrating humour, and talented political commentary. His funeral was attended by an unusually large number of famous individuals from all walks of life. A tribute show was broadcast on New Year's Day, 2012.

He received his first training from 1883-86 at the Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts, then at the Academy of Karlsruhe under de:Gustav Schönleber (1851–1917) and finally at the Berlin Academy in the studio of Hans Gude (1825–1903). Another of Gude's student during this period was de:Georg Müller vom Siel (1865–1939). In 1905 he married his student, Else Schwager, and was appointed professor a year later. From 1908 he lived in Hamburg, later becoming a member of the Hamburg Artists Association. In 1904 he and his wife were founder members of the Oldenburg Art Society. Müller-Kaempff was a successful landscape artist. He produced watercolours, pastels and drawings as well as furniture designs and a multitude of postcards. He was also an accomplished lithographer and produced bird illustrations for the revised edition of Naumann's \""Naturgeschichte der Vögel Mitteleuropas\"". During his lifetime his works are acquired by museums in Rostock, Oldenburg, Kiel and Hamburg, and bought by numerous private collectors as far afield as Argentina and China. Prince Eitel Friedrich, the second son of Emperor Wilhelm II, acquired several of Müller-Kaempff's pieces for the imperial court in 1908. Müller-Kaempff stayed in touch with his former fellow-student, Georg Müller vom Siel, and visited him at Dötlingen in June 1908. On a hike in 1889 with his friend, Oskar Frenzel (1855–1915), they discovered the secluded fishing village of Ahrenshoop. Müller-Kaempff was so inspired by the isolated hamlet that he moved there, built himself a house in 1892, and started the painting school of St. Lucas in 1894.

"Hans Krell (c. 1490-1565 or 1586), also Krehl ou Kreil, was a German painter of the Renaissance, mainly known as a portrait painter. He is thought to have been born in Crailsheim or Ansbach, and died in Leipzig. Hans Krell started his career as court painter of George the Pious, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach in Ansbach. Then he entered into the service of King Louis II of Hungary in Prague and Buda, where he was employed as court portraitist in the years 1522-1526. Then he is recorded in Leipzig (from 1531) and in Freiberg in Saxony (since 1534). Krell was known as the Fürstenmaler (Painter of Princes) in service of the German Princes - Albrecht of Brandenburg-Ansbach, Duke in Prussia, Hedwig Jagiellon, Electress of Brandenburg and the Elector Augustus of Saxony. Hans Krell is credited by Dieter Koepplin as the author of a painting long associated with Lucas Cranach the Elder or his workshop - Battle of Orsha, painted around 1524-1530. The painting, today displayed in the National Museum in Warsaw, depicts the battle which was fought on 8 September 1514 between the allied forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland and the army of Grand Duchy of Moscow. According to the specialists, the author must have taken part in the battle himself due to high knowledge of the subject. Krell's connections with the Jagiellonian dynasty patrons (including King of Hungary) and rulers of Prussia makes this attribution highly probable. The author of the painting portraited himself in the painting observing the battle and gazing upwards through intertwined fingers.",art,0
"David Victor \""Dave\"" Sim (born 17 May 1956) is a Canadian cartoonist and publisher, best known for his comic book Cerebus, his artistic experimentation, his advocacy of self-publishing and creator's rights, and his controversial political, philosophical and religious beliefs. Sim dropped out of high school to pursue a career in comics, and rose to prominence after he began Cerebus in December 1977. Initially, Cerebus was a parody of Conan the Barbarian and other sword and sorcery comics, but after two years Sim came to conceive of the series as a self-complete work, which would run for 300 issues and be subdivided into \""novels\"". By the time the 6000-page work was completed in March 2004, Sim had delved into politics, theology, metaphysics, and a controversial examination of feminism and gender issues, while becoming progressively more sophisticated and experimental in his storytelling and artwork. Sim worked on Cerebus Archives after completing Cerebus, and produced the comic books Glamourpuss, which examines the history of photorealistic comics, and Judenhass, about the Holocaust. Sim co-founded the small press publisher Aardvark-Vanaheim with his wife-to-be, Deni Loubert, in 1977; most of the titles it published moved to Loubert's Renegade Press after their divorce in the mid-1980s. The publishing company was later co-owned by Sim's creative partner, Gerhard, who dissolved their partnership and sold his stake in the company to Sim in 2007. Sim is a pioneer and advocate of self-publishing as an ideal, and was one of the key figures in the creation of the Creator's Bill of Rights in 1988. His relationship with his readers, colleagues and friends has often been strained, sometimes by the content of his work, and often by his expressed opinions and personal interactions. Most prominently, some have labeled Sim a misogynist, though he denies the charge and has refused to maintain contact with anyone who will not sign a form letter denying that he is a misogynist. This has resulted in a break with many of his former friends. His idiosyncratic religious conversion in 1996 has coloured his work and writing since, including the later Cerebus novels. He has criticized the use of copyright to restrict creators, and has made arrangements for his body of work to fall into the public domain following his death.",art,0

"St Patrick's College is a state-integrated Catholic boys' day and boarding Secondary School located in Silverstream, Upper Hutt, New Zealand. It was established by the Society of Mary (Marists) in 1931 when the original St Patrick's College, Wellington (established 1885) was intended to be moved to a larger site more suited to a boarding school. In fact both Colleges survived and today share not only a common history, motto and spirit but also a good natured rivalry and competition in many endeavours. Silverstreamers refer to the mother school simply as 'Town'. The Silverstream College, quite often referred to simply by the suburb title or 'stream', is situated in 7 hectares of grounds between the Hutt River and the Silverstream Railway Station close to the suburbs of Silverstream and Heretaunga. As an integrated school, St Patrick's College is funded by the Society of Mary, Catholic Schools Board Limited and the New Zealand Government. In the 1980s, St Patrick's record was marred by a member of staff being involved in incidents of sexual abuse involving students. Reports of this sexual abuse were allegedly suppressed by the school Marist priests. At its foundation much of the original College was transferred from the Wellington site including many of the Marist teachers, much of the memorabilia and the College colours. The brother Colleges today share an Old Boys' Association in recognition of their common heritage. School sports teams have enjoyed success in Rugby union, cricket and athletics. Football, hockey and basketball are popular winter sports at the college. Over the years of the College it has evolved from being primarily a boarding school into a largely day school with a small boarding facility. This demographic shift has resulted from several pressures including the huge increase in number of residents in the local area. In more recent years it has been necessary to cap the roll and introduce an enrolment scheme to ensure an equitable educational outcome for all local pupils. The College celebrated its 75th Jubilee in 2006. St Patrick’s College as a Catholic School bases its educational philosophy on Christian teachings and on the Marist tradition under which the school was founded. In 2012 the St Patrick's College, Silverstream Foundation was established with an inaugural dinner.

Typically, the enrollment period is over on the first Monday of February with the lottery the next day. Since 2007 there has been a waiting list to get into Great River, simply because so many people want to attend. On a regular basis, both the Junior and Senior High students meet in their respective groups in a community meeting to discuss various topics that impact the whole community. The elected student leaders lead this meeting, and the school talks about \""important\"" issues.

"Geneva Reformed Seminary is a small theological school in Greenville, South Carolina accredited by the Association of Reformed Theological Seminaries and supported by the Free Presbyterian Church of North America. The seminary offers a B.D. and an M.Div. Initially called Whitefield College of the Bible after a companion school in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, the seminary was renamed in 2002 to avoid confusion in the United States where Bible schools and seminaries prepare students at different academic levels. Faith Free Presbyterian Church of Greenville, South Carolina, the first constituted congregation of the Free Presbyterian Church in the United States (1977), had had from its inception a vision of becoming the progenitor of other Free Presbyterian churches in North America. In 1982, Alan Cairns, an Ulsterman and the first pastor of the Greenville church, was commissioned by the Free Presbyterian Church to become the first professor of the new theological school, with teachers from Northern Ireland assisting on an adjunct basis. Training was limited to men preparing for the ministry of the Free Presbyterian Church. Both the Church and its seminary acknowledge the Westminster Confession of Faith and its exposition of Reformed theology, which they believe to be taught by the Bible. Nevertheless, they modify the Westminster Standards by permitting liberty of conscience regarding baptism and eschatology. In an advertising brochure published in 2008, the seminary declared its intent \""to avoid the lamentable abuses\"" of covenant theology by pursuing \""a strongly fervent evangelistic mission....[a] biblical, fundamental, separatist, evangelistic, and Reformed ministry.\"" Ian Paisley, the former moderator of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, had had a long-standing relationship with Bob Jones University, also located in Greenville, and by February 2007, every GRS faculty member was both a graduate of Bob Jones University and a minister or licentiate minister of the Free Presbyterian Church. In 2001 the Presbytery Commission appointed Michael Barrett, who had earned a Ph.D. in theology from BJU, as president. Admission to the seminary was thereafter opened to members of other denominations. In May 2008, the presbytery approved a certificate program for laypersons, some evening classes, and the introduction of online courses, and by the fall of 2010, eighteen courses were available for online credit or audit.

"Summerhill School is a mixed community secondary school located in Kingswinford, West Midlands, England. The school was built by Brierley Hill Urban District Council in 1961, and serves an area of Kingswinford which was mostly developed after the Second World War. The catchment for the school is bounded in the south by Lawnswood Road (Wordsley), in the east by Stream Road and Moss Grove (Kingswinford) and in the north and west by the county boundary between West Midlands and Staffordshire. The 1961 buildings were becoming increasingly dilapidated during the 1990s, and by September 2003 the entire school had been rebuilt. but was completely rebuilt in the early 2000s. One remaining building from the old complex, built in 1993 and known as C Block remained after the demolition of the old school and was the subject of a bid to save it from demolition and reopen as a community arts centre. The plan was developed but opposition from Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council prevented the plans from going ahead. C Block remained standing for five years until 5 November 2008, when the roof was destroyed in an arson attack. The building was finally demolished in 2011 and now acts as a parking area. Positioning of the county boundary sign on the A4101 in the early 1980s gave the impression that half of the tennis/netball courts and 2/3 of one of the football pitches were in the county of Staffordshire rather than West Midlands. The sign was moved sometime in the 1990s, aligning it with the west edge of the school grounds.

"The Nebbishes was a syndicated comic strip by Herb Gardner, better known today as a playwright and screenwriter. Gardner's characters were white blob-like creatures who expressed their attitude toward existence in mottos and quotes on greeting cards and statuettes. In the comic strip they engaged in dialogue in balloons in the standard comic strip format. Gardner first began drawing these characters while he was a student at Antioch College. As an English word from Yiddish, \""nebbish\"" means an insignificant, pitiful person; a nonentity (from Yiddish interjection nebekh \""poor thing!\"", and from Czech nebohý). On local New York television, Gardner drew The Nebbishes on Shari Lewis' WPIX Kartoon Klub show, as noted by Kevin S. Butler: Long before he became one of Broadway's most prolific playwrights, Herb Gardner was a comic strip artist for the New York Daily News.

"Channel Chuckles was a television-themed comic panel created by Bil Keane which appeared in newspapers from 1954 through 1976. Keane received the National Cartoonists Society's 1976 Special Features Award for his work on the strip. In its daily form, Channel Chuckles was a single-panel gag on the general theme of television, or specifically relating to a popular television series or TV commercial. The Sunday version of Channel Chuckles consisted of several unrelated spot gags in color. Most of the Channel Chuckles gags were simple wordplay references to the titles of contemporary television programs. For example, one gag showed a small TV set on top of a larger TV set, each of them displaying on its screen the title of a current TV sitcom. While the upper TV set showed Love on a Rooftop, the one underneath blared Hey, Landlord!. One Channel Chuckles gag was a caricature of Mr. Spock from Star Trek receiving letters requesting advice on child-rearing (a reference to Doctor Benjamin Spock). Another Channel Chuckles gag depicted a mad scientist working in his laboratory while a nearby television intoned the slogan of a current DuPont ad campaign: \""Better Living Through Chemistry\"". Another familiar slogan was lampooned in a panel showing a little boy watching a General Electric commercial while his father said, \""And progress is our most important product. Do your homework!\"" Keane would sometimes subdivide the narrow space allotted to his Channel Chuckles feature in order to squeeze in two panels. One two-panel gag was based on the titles of two current TV series. In the first panel, a man asks his wife \""Why can't you be more like that show?\"" while pointing to a TV set as it displays the title Occasional Wife. In the second panel, the wife points to the same TV while asking her husband \""And why can't you be more like that show?\"". Her TV screen showed the title The Man Who Never Was. Some gags featured \""Aunt Tenna\"", a matronly woman with her hair done in the form of a TV antenna, who spent all her time watching television or engaged in TV-related activities. The other recurring character in Channel Chuckles was \""Dim Viewer\"", a grumpy old man who always had something negative to say about television programming, commercials or reception. Other gags poked fun at the genre of mother-daughter look-alikes television commercials of the late 1960s, such as the Grape-Nuts look-alikes, Mrs. Burke and her daughter Dale.",games,4

The Sorrow of a Perfectly Healthy Girl) is a hentai manga series by Wanyan Aguda, which debuted in 1998 and spanned 5 volumes.

"Mobile Fighter G Gundam, also known in Japan as Mobile Fighting Legend G Gundam (機動武闘伝Gガンダム Kidō Butōden Jī Gandamu), is a 1994 Japanese animated television series produced by Sunrise and the fifth installment in the long running Gundam franchise. The series is set in the \""Future Century\"", where space colonies representing countries have agreed to hold an organized fighting tournament known as the \""Gundam Fight\"" every four years to settle their political differences in place of war. Each colony sends a representative fighter piloting a giant, humanoid mecha called a Gundam to battle on Earth until only one is left, and the winning nation earns the right to govern over all the colonies until the next tournament. The events of G Gundam follow Domon Kasshu, the pilot of Neo Japan's Shining Gundam during the 13th Gundam Fight. Domon's mission is to both win the tournament and to track down his older brother, who is believed to have stolen the mysterious Devil Gundam from the Neo Japan government. Commemorating the 15th anniversary of the Gundam brand, G Gundam was produced to reboot the waning popularity of the long-running franchise. It is the first Gundam series with a self-contained plot set in an alternate calendar era from the original \""Universal Century\"" timeline. Additionally, the show casts aside many of the conventions set by its predecessors and takes many new steps for its franchise, such as a focus on martial arts and decisive, personal duels as opposed to large-scale military conflicts. G Gundam was directed by Yasuhiro Imagawa, with its settings and characters significantly influenced by the director's interest in world cinema. The anime's real world locales were drawn from numerous foreign films and were planned using location scouting. G Gundam ran for 49 episodes on Japan's TV Asahi from April 1, 1994 to March 31, 1995. An English-language version produced by Bandai Entertainment aired in the United States on Cartoon Network's Toonami block beginning on August 5, 2002. Since its original broadcast, G Gundam has spawned manga, audio albums, video games, guide books, and several lines of scale models. During its conception and Japanese television debut, G Gundam was met with controversy among its production staff, sponsors, and fans because the show takes a wildly different turn from all previous entries in the Gundam universe. However, for that very reason the series is cited as a milestone in its long-running franchise and ultimately proved very popular in the region. Reception for G Gundam has been generally positive in North America. Reviewers praised the primary characters and mecha as unique and stylized, but strongly disagreed on the plot. While some critics enjoyed the bold and campy divergence from the more dramatic social and political undertones traditional of Gundam, others found G Gundam's story diffusely shallow, repetitive, or not up to standards set by its anime predecessors.",games,4

"Peräsmies is a Finnish underground comic strip drawn by Timo Kokkila that appeared in the Pahkasika magazine from 1983 to 2000. The strips were initially written by Kokkila together with Sami Laitala. Other scriptwriters have also occasionally participated in the comic. The comic depicts the adventures of Peräsmies, a Finnish superhero and a parody of Superman. The name Peräsmies literally means \""Butt Man\"" and is a play off Teräsmies (\""Steel man\"") which is the Finnish name for Superman. The \""official\"" English name of Peräsmies, according to Kokkila, is \""Phartman\"", although \""Pooperman\"" might better capture the essence of the original pun. Peräsmies is a middle-aged, severely alcoholic homeless man living in a landfill, whose only superpower is the ability to fart supernaturally hard. He gained this power as a result of consuming a can of radioactive pea soup, pea soup being the stereotypical flatulence-inducing dish in Finland. Peräsmies uses farting primarily as a rocket engine, which enables him to fly. On some occasions Peräsmies has used farts as a chemical weapon. His farts have also had more esoteric uses such as melting holes in ice. Despite his alcoholism and lack of any semblance of personal hygiene, he has good intentions and often manages to save the world in the end. One notable Peräsmies strip set the hero against his Soviet counterpart, Toveri Pieru (\""Comrade Fart\""). They first competed against each other by saving people from disasters, but finally Peräsmies challenged Toveri Pieru to a drinking competition, which Peräsmies won. The strip ended with a moral lesson: Remember, children — violence is not a solution to problems, but alcohol is. Peräsmies was killed by a drunk driver in the last issue of Pahkasika. However, a sequel titled Peräsmiehen poika (\""Son of Peräsmies\"") has been appearing in the Koululainen magazine since 2003. The Finnish Film Foundation has agreed to support the Finnish film studio Helsinki-filmi to make a film about Peräsmies.",games,4

"Frumpy the Clown is a comic-strip written and illustrated by Judd Winick and appeared from 1996 to 1998. Despite the fact that it only ran for two years and appeared only in 30 newspapers (the largest being the Chicago Sun-Times), it had a fair sized fan base. The strip began when Brad Bragg, a 10-year-old kid, brought back a clown to live with his family. The parents were reluctant, but since the kids loved him, they decided to let him stay. Frumpy is a far cry from a normal clown. Though he has the white face, green hair, red nose, huge feet and polka-dotted jumpsuit one might expect, he's fairly grouchy, a chain-smoker, and twice divorced. He doesn't enjoy being stereotyped as an entertainer, and doesn't do magic tricks, balloon animals, or comedy bits. He does love children, however, and teaches elementary school in order to help kids grow up right in the modern world. In the summer, he works as a camp counselor. Characters other than Frumpy include Mike and Mona Bragg, parents, and their kids Kim and Brad. It is notable that the Bragg family was Jewish, setting them apart from the average generic comic strip family. This fact was not treated as a big deal, and was only an important plot point in one storyline. (See below) Other characters including Nana (Mike's mother), Principal Carr (principal of Vanderbilt Elementary School, where Frumpy teaches), Lumus (Mike Braggs' cousin) and the Bragg family's cat Frodo (although the cat was introduced in January 1997, her name wasn't revealed until May 1998). Although this strip is mostly comedy, it did have some serious moments. For example, the storyline where Nana was revealed a Holocaust survivor. Unfortunately, the strip ran into controversy. Many parents complained that this strip was inappropriate and unsuitable. At the same time, the cartoonist became burnt out and grew tired of doing the strip. The strip ended with a week-long storyline where the clown announced the family he's moving out. The clown rode down the street on an elephant while the family gave him a teary good-bye.",games,4

"G.I. Joe: Sigma 6 is a line of military-themed action figures and toys produced by Hasbro, re-imagining the characters of the 1980s toyline, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero. The Sigma 6 toy line served several purposes for Hasbro. First, it allowed them to depart from the classic 3 ¾-inch format of the A Real American Hero series of the 1980s; most Sigma 6 action figures stand at approximately 8 inches (200 mm) and have more articulation. Second, the new series offered them the chance to streamline the story and characters, stripping away old continuity and \""rebooting\"" the franchise with younger versions of the cast - similar to but different from their 1980s namesakes - rendered in the popular anime style. The line proved to be polarizing with G.I. Joe fans and ultimately unsuccessful at retail. Sigma 6 was cancelled after two years leaving many showcased sets and characters unproduced.

The plot of Phantom Quest Corp. revolves around Ayaka Kisaragi, the proprietor of a Shinjuku, Tokyo company dedicated to helping those in need of paranormal aid.

Orbiting just below the prominent 7:3 resonance with Jupiter, 349 Dembowska is among the larger asteroids in the main belt with an estimated diameter of ~140 km. It has a rotational period of 4.7012 hours, and is classified as an R-type asteroid for the presence of strong absorption lines in olivine and pyroxene with little or no metals. It may have undergone partial melting/differentiation. 349 Dembowska has an unusually high albedo of 0.384. Of the asteroids with a diameter greater than 75 km, only 4 Vesta has a higher known albedo. Dembowska and 16 Psyche have orbits that repeat themselves almost exactly every five years in respect to their position to the Sun and Earth. In 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but the effort came up empty. There was one occultation on October 31, 2006, and on December 5, 2007.",astrology-astronomy,1
"NGC 5964 is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Serpens Caput. NGC 5964 is also known by the names IC 4551 and PGC 55637. NGC 5964 has relatively unwound spiral arms, it lacks the clear defined spiral arms the Milky Way galaxy has. The central bar is very small, long and thin. NGC 5964 thus does not have a galactic habitable zone like the Milky Way.  For the Milky Way, the galactic habitable zone is commonly believed to be an annulus with an outer radius of about 10 kiloparsecs and an inner radius close to the Galactic Center, both of which lack hard boundaries.",astrology-astronomy,1
"NGC 2217 is a nearly face-on lenticular galaxy of about 100 thousand light-years across that lies roughly 65 million light years from Earth in the constellation of Canis Major. It is part of the NGC 2217 Group of galaxies. It is classified as a barred spiral galaxy A notable feature is the swirling shape of this galaxy. In its very concentrated central region we can see a distinctive, very luminous bar of stars within an oval ring. Further out, a set of tightly wound spiral arms almost form a circular ring around the galaxy. Central bars play an important role in the development of a galaxy. They can, for example, funnel gas towards the center of the galaxy, helping to feed a central black hole, or to form new stars.",astrology-astronomy,1

"13390 Bouška, provisional designation 1999 FQ3, is a stony Eunomia asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Czech astronomers Petr Pravec and Marek Wolf at Ondřejov Observatory in the Czech Republic on 18 March 1999. The asteroid is a member of the Eunomia family, a large group of S-type asteroids and the most prominent family in the intermediate main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.1–3.0 AU once every 4 years and 2 months (1,517 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.18 and an inclination of 13° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was obtained at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station in 1981, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 18 years prior to its discovery. A rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations made at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory, California, in January 2012. It gave a rotation period of 7.7572±0.0027 hours with a brightness variation of 0.30 in magnitude (U=2). According to the surveys carried out by NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures 7.5 and 7.0 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.26 and 0.27, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.21 – derived from 15 Eunomia, the family's largest member and namesake – and calculates a diameter of 6.5 kilometers. The minor planet is named in honor of astronomer and retired professor at Charles University, Jiří Bouška (b. 1925), whose research concentrated on the material found between the planets of the Solar System. He has been a teacher of several generations of Czech astronomers, including one of the discoverers. For decades he has also been the editor of the Czech Astronomical Yearbook and the popular astronomy journal Ríše hvězd (The Realm of Stars), after which the minor planet 4090 Říšehvězd is named.

"1235 Schorria, provisional designation 1931 UJ, is an asteroid from the innermost region of the asteroid belt, about 9 kilometers in diameter. The Mars-crosser is one of the slowest rotating asteroids known to exist. It was discovered on 18 October 1931, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany. The asteroid is classified as both, C-type and X-type on the Tholen scheme. It is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. The body orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.6–2.2 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (964 days). Its orbit is tilted by 25 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows an eccentricity of 0.15. Contrary to the expected low albedo for dark, carbonaceous CX-type asteroids, the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) assumes a high albedo of 0.40 for the body. This is rather typical for the descendants of the E-belt, a hypothesized population of primordial asteroids, from which the E-type Hungarian asteroids with high inclinations and a semi-major axis of 1.9 AU are thought to have originated. Based on light-curve observations conducted at the U.S. Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado during February through April 2009, it has an outstandingly long rotation period of 1265±80 hours, or about 52 days, with a high brightness amplitude of 1.40 in magnitude. This makes the asteroid among the slowest rotators known. The body was also a suspected \""tumbler\"". However, no significant evidence of such a non-principal axis rotation could be found. It was named after Richard Schorr (1867–1951), astronomer at Bergedorf Observatory, Hamburg, who discovered the minor planets 869 Mellena and 1240 Centenaria. The lunar crater Schorr is also named in his honour.",astrology-astronomy,1

"317 Roxane is an asteroid from the asteroid belt approximately 19 km in diameter. It was discovered by Auguste Charlois from Nice on September 11, 1891. The name was chosen by F. Bidschof, an assistant at the Vienna Observatory, at Charlois's request; Bidschof chose to name it after Roxana, the wife of Alexander the Great, and at first used the spelling Roxana. In 2008, a team identified Roxane as the closest known spectroscopic match for the Peña Blanca Spring meteorite that landed in a swimming pool in Texas in 1946. There is a possibility, therefore, that 317 Roxane is from the same parent object as this meteorite. In 2009, a team using the Gemini-North adaptive optics telescope discovered a moon orbiting Roxane. The moon is provisionally named S/2009 (317) 1.

"Clementine (officially called the Deep Space Program Science Experiment (DSPSE)) was a joint space project between the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO, previously the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, or SDIO) and NASA. Launched on January 25, 1994, the objective of the mission was to test sensors and spacecraft components under extended exposure to the space environment and to make scientific observations of the Moon and the near-Earth asteroid 1620 Geographos. The Geographos observations were not made due to a malfunction in the spacecraft. The lunar observations made included imaging at various wavelengths in the visible as well as in ultraviolet and infrared, laser ranging altimetry, gravimetry, and charged particle measurements. These observations were for the purposes of obtaining multi-spectral imaging of the entire lunar surface, assessing the surface mineralogy of the Moon, obtaining altimetry from 60N to 60S latitude, and obtaining gravity data for the near side. There were also plans to image and determine the size, shape, rotational characteristics, surface properties, and cratering statistics of Geographos. Clementine carried seven distinct experiments on-board: a UV/Visible Camera, a Near Infrared Camera, a Long Wavelength Infrared Camera, a High Resolution Camera, two Star Tracker Cameras, a Laser Altimeter, and a Charged Particle Telescope.

"1511 Daléra, provisional designation 1939 FB, is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 8 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by French astronomer Louis Boyer at the Algerian Algiers Observatory, North Africa, on 22 March 1939. The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.1–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 7 months (1,322 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.11 and is tilted by 4 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has a rotation period of 3.9 and 4.2 hours, determined by independent observations in 2015, respectively. Based on NASA's magnitude-to-diameter conversion table, and on an absolute magnitude of 12.8, its diameter could be anywhere between 7 and 17 kilometers, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25. Data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, gave a large diameter of 15 kilometers, based on a corresponding low albedo of 0.06, which is typical for dark asteroids with a carbonaceous composition. However, the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) calculates the body's diameter to be much smaller, about 7 kilometers in diameter, using a transformed absolute magnitude of 13.1 and an assumed, higher albedo of 0.20, which is a typical value for silicaceous asteroids, that are abundant in the inner main-belt. In general, estimates of an asteroid's size are commonly based on the body's brightness. For a given absolute magnitude, the lower the body's reflectivity (albedo), the larger its calculated diameter.

"S/2004 S 6 is the provisional designation of a dusty object seen orbiting Saturn very close to the F ring. It is not clear whether it is only a transient clump of dust, or if there is a solid moonlet at its core. It was first seen by scientists in images taken by the Cassini-Huygens probe on October 28, 2004 and announced on November 8 that year. It appears to be the best tracked object in this region with at least five probable sightings in the period to late 2005. In comparison, two objects in the F ring's vicinity (S/2004 S 3 and S/2004 S 4) that were first seen several months earlier have not been recovered with any confidence. Nevertheless, it continues to be unclear whether there is a solid core to S/2004 S 6 or whether it is just a transient dust clump that will dissipate on a timescale of years or months. Notably, an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on November 15, 2004 (soon after S/2004 S 6's discovery) failed to recover the object, while it has been seen again later. The lighting conditions in S/2004 S 6's part of the orbit were different during these two observations, however, with the discovery being made when the region was strongly backlit by the sun. A suggested resolution of the absence in November is that S/2004 S 6's visibility is primarily due to a diffuse cloud of fine dust that is much brighter in forward scattered light (the conditions of the discovery image), and that the solid core (if any) is small. S/2004 S 6 has been seen both inside and outside the main F ring, and its orbit must cross the ring. Careful calculations show that the object periodically plows through the ring material, coming within 1.5 km of the densest core e.g. on 9 April 2005. It has been suggested that a spiral structure in the tenuous material surrounding the F ring may have been a consequence of this. The dusty halo seen in images is sizeable, being around 2000 km in lengthwise extent. The solid object, if any, would be no greater than 3–5 km in diameter based on brightness. Additional evidence came in 2008, as it appears that S/2004 S 6 or a body like it is required to explain the dynamics of the F Ring.",astrology-astronomy,1

"34351 Decatur, provisional designation 2000 RZ8, is an asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 3 September 2000, by American amateur astronomer Loren C. Ball at his U.S. Emerald Lane Observatory in Decatur, Alabama. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.2 AU once every 5 years and 1 month (1,846 days). Its orbit has a low eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 1° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Steward Observatory (Kitt Peak-Spacewatch) in 1992, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. As of 2016, the asteroid's effective size, its composition and albedo, as well as its rotation period and shape remain unknown. Based on an absolute magnitude of 14.7, the asteroid is calculated to measure between 3 and 7 kilometers in diameter, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25. The minor planet is named after the city of Decatur in the U.S. state of Alabama, location of the discovering observatory and home of the discoverer.

"Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 67 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury. Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft, most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the Galileo orbiter. In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016. Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa.",astrology-astronomy,1

"1845 Helewalda, provisional designation 1972 UC, is a carbonaceous asteroid in the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 25 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Swiss astronomer Paul Wild at Zimmerwald Observatory near Bern, Switzerland, on 30 October 1972. The C-typeasteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.8–3.1 AU once every 5 years and 1 month (1,868 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 11° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Lowell Observatory in 1931, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 41 years prior to its discovery. Based on observations made by French astronomer René Roy in March 2010, Helewalda has a well-determined rotation period of 7.2786±0.0002 hours with a brightness variation of 0.26 in magnitude (U=3-). Between 2009 and 2015, other light-curves were obtained at the Oakley Southern Sky Observatory in Australia (E09), the Via Capote Observatory at Thousand Oaks, California (G69), and the Palomar Transient Factory at Palomar Observatory. They gave a similar period of 7.399±0.004, 7.4±0.1 and 7.3985±0.0098 hours with a corresponding amplitude of 0.20, 0.28 and 0.15, respectively (U=2/2+/2).

"19848 Yeungchuchiu, provisional designation 2000 TR, is a stony Eos asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 13 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Canadian amateur astronomer William Yeung at the U.S. Desert Beaver Observatory in Arizona, on 2 October 2000. It is the largest minor planet found by the discoverer, just 1°.2 west of Jupiter. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Eos family, an orbital group of more than 4,000 asteroids, which are known for mostly being of stony composition. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.8–3.2 AU once every 5 years and 3 months (1,905 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 11° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at the Australian Siding Spring Observatory in 1982, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 18 years prior to its discovery. In 2005, a photometric light-curve analysis by the discoverer at the Desert Eagle Observatory in Arizona, rendered a well-defined rotation period of 3.450±0.002 hours with a brightness variation of 0.70 in magnitude (U=3). The large amplitude suggests that the body is of non-spherical shape and that the long axis is almost twice as long as the short axis. It is likely that the rotational axis was almost perpendicular to the observation's line-of-sight. A second light-curve was obtained at the Palomar Transient Factory in September 2010, and gave a concurring period of 3.4508±0.0003 hours with an amplitude of 0.63 in magnitude (U=2). According to the surveys carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures 11.7 and 13.2 kilometers in diameter with an albedo for its surface of 0.17 and 0.21, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link also assumes an albedo of 0.21 and calculates a diameter of 12.9 kilometers for the stony asteroid.

The Earth-MOID is 0.0100 AU (1,500,000 km; 930,000 mi). Its orbit is well-determined for the next several hundred years. The asteroid made its closest approach to Earth on April 1, 1977, at a nominal distance of 0.03216 AU (4,811,000 km; 2,989,000 mi). It will make its next closest approach on April 2, 2064, at a nominal distance of 0.0546 AU (8,170,000 km; 5,080,000 mi).",astrology-astronomy,1
"(144897) 2004 UX10 is a Kuiper-belt object.

"Canes Venatici II or CVn II is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy situated in the Canes Venatici constellation and discovered in 2006 in the data obtained by Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The galaxy is located at the distance of about 150 kpc from the Sun and moves towards the Sun with the velocity of about 130 km/s. It is classified as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) meaning that it has an elliptical (ratio of axes ~ 2:1) shape with the half-light radius of about 74+14−10 pc. CVn II is one of the smallest and faintest satellites of the Milky Way—its integrated luminosity is about 8,000 times that of the Sun (absolute visible magnitude of about −4.9), which is much lower than the luminosity of a typical globular cluster. However, its mass is about 2.5 million solar masses, which means that galaxy's mass to light ratio is around 340. A high mass to light ratio implies that CVn II is dominated by the dark matter. The stellar population of CVn II consists mainly of old stars formed more than 12 billion years ago. The metallicity of these old stars is also very low at [Fe/H] ≈ −2.19±0.58, which means that they contain 150 times less heavy elements than the Sun. The stars of CVn II were probably among the first stars to form in the Universe. Currently there is no star formation in CVn II. The measurement have so far failed to detect neutral hydrogen in it—the upper limit is 14000 solar masses.",astrology-astronomy,1

"253 Mathilde /məˈtɪldə/ is a main-belt asteroid about 50 km in diameter that was discovered by Johann Palisa in 1885. It has a relatively elliptical orbit that requires more than four years to circle the Sun. This asteroid has an unusually slow rate of rotation, requiring 17.4 days to complete a 360° revolution about its axis. It is a primitive C-type asteroid, which means the surface has a high proportion of carbon; giving it a dark surface that reflects only 4% of the light that falls on it. This asteroid was visited by the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft during June 1997, on its way to asteroid 433 Eros. During the flyby, the spacecraft imaged a hemisphere of the asteroid, revealing many large craters that have gouged out depressions in the surface. It was the first C-type asteroid to be explored and, until 21 Lutetia was visited in 2010, it was the largest asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft.",astrology-astronomy,1

"1995 Hajek, provisional designation 1971 UP1, is a metallic asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt. It was discovered by Czech astronomer Luboš Kohoutek at the Bergedorf Observatory in Hamburg, Germany, on 26 October 1971. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.4–2.7 AU once every 4.02 years (1,469 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.05 and is tilted by 11 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has a provisional rotation period of 10 hours and measurements of its spectral properties identified it as a metallic X-type asteroid. Observations by the Akari and WISE satellites, as well as calculations by the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL), rendered a divergent estimated of the body's diameter in a large range of 6.5 to 15.3 kilometers. Likewise, the body's albedo also varies between 0.04 and 0.08 for the satellite-based observations, while CALL assumes an albedo of 0.20. These contrasting albedo and diameter figures closely correspond to a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, where, for an absolute magnitude of 13.3, the body's diameter is in the range of about 6 to 14 kilometers, based on an albedo between 0.05 and 0.25. The minor planet is named after the Bohemian astronomer Tadeáš Hájek (1525–1600), better known by his Latinized name, Thaddaeus Hagecius. He was one of the founders of modern stellar and cometary astronomy, who studied the Great Comet of 1577 and the supernova SN 1572, also known as Tycho's Nova.

"The Spitzer Space Telescope (SST), formerly the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF), is an infrared space observatory launched in 2003. It is the fourth and final of the NASA Great Observatories program. The planned mission period was to be 2.5 years with a pre-launch expectation that the mission could extend to five or slightly more years until the onboard liquid helium supply was exhausted. This occurred on 15 May 2009. Without liquid helium to cool the telescope to the very low temperatures needed to operate, most of the instruments are no longer usable. However, the two shortest-wavelength modules of the  camera are still operable with the same sensitivity as before the cryogen was exhausted, and will continue to be used in the Spitzer Warm Mission. All Spitzer data, from both the primary and warm phases, are archived at the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA). In keeping with NASA tradition, the telescope was renamed after its successful demonstration of operation, on 18 December 2003. Unlike most telescopes that are named after famous deceased astronomers by a board of scientists, the new name for SIRTF was obtained from a contest open to the general public. The contest led to the telescope being named in honor of astronomer Lyman Spitzer, who had promoted the concept of space telescopes in the 1940s. Spitzer wrote a 1946 report for RAND Corporation describing the advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory and how it could be realized with available or upcoming technology. He has been cited for his pioneering contributions to rocketry and astronomy, as well as \""his vision and leadership in articulating the advantages and benefits to be realized from the Space Telescope Program.\"" The US$800 million Spitzer was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, on a Delta II 7920H ELV rocket, Monday, 25 August 2003 at 13:35:39 UTC-5 (EDT). It follows a heliocentric instead of geocentric orbit, trailing and drifting away from Earth's orbit at approximately 0.1 astronomical unit per year (a so-called \""earth-trailing\"" orbit). The primary mirror is 85 centimeters (33 in) in diameter, f/12, made of beryllium and was cooled to 5.5 K (−267.65 °C; −449.77 °F).

"NGC 4762 is an edge-on lenticular galaxy in the constellation Virgo. It is at a distance of 60 million light years and is a member of the Virgo Cluster. The edge-on view of this particular galaxy, originally considered to be a barred spiral galaxy, makes it difficult to determine its true shape, but it is considered that the galaxy consists of four main components — a central bulge, a bar, a thick disc and an outer ring. The galaxy's disc is asymmetric and warped, which could be explained by NGC 4762 mergering with a smaller galaxy in the past. The remains of this former companion may then have settled within NGC 4762's disc, redistributing the gas and stars and so changing the disc's morphology. NGC 4762 contains a Liner-type active galactic nucleus, a highly energetic central region. This nucleus is detectable due to its particular spectral line emission, allowing astronomers to measure the composition of the region.",astrology-astronomy,1
"3181 Ahnert, provisional designation 1964 EC, is a stony Flora asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 8 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by German astronomer Freimut Börngen at the Karl Schwarzschild Observatory in Tautenburg, eastern Germany, on 8 March 1964. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.1–2.4 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,216 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was obtained at Lowell Observatory in 1931, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 33 years prior to its discovery. According to the surveys carried out by NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures 8.6 and 8.5 kilometers and its surface has an albedo of 0.19 and 0.26, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an intermediate albedo of 0.24 – derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of this orbital family – and calculates a slightly smaller diameter of 8.2 kilometers. As of 2016, the asteroid's rotation period and shape still remain unknown. The minor planet was named after German astronomer Paul Ahnert (1897–1989), author of the Kalender für Sternfreunde (an annual calendar of astronomical events) and a renowned astronomer among professionals and amateurs. His fields of research included the physics of the Solar System and periods of variable stars at the Sonneberg Observatory. (The minor planet 1039 Sonneberga is named after this observatory.)

"WT1190F (9U01FF6, UDA34A3, or UW8551D) was a small temporary satellite of Earth that impacted Earth on 13 November 2015 at 06:18:34.3 (±1.3 seconds) UTC. It is thought to have been space debris from the trans-lunar injection stage of the 1998 Lunar Prospector mission, It was first discovered on 18 February 2013 by the Catalina Sky Survey. It was then lost, and reacquired on 29 November 2013. It was again discovered on 3 October 2015, and the object was soon identified to be the same as the two objects previously sighted by the team, who have been sharing their data through the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center (MPC). An early orbit calculation showed that it was orbiting Earth in an extremely elliptical orbit, taking it from within the geosynchronous satellite ring to nearly twice the distance of the Moon. It was also probably the same object as 9U01FF6, another object on a similar orbit discovered on 26 October 2009. WT1190F had been orbiting Earth as a temporary satellite since mid 2009 (named as UWAIS), if not longer. While it has not been positively identified with any known artificial satellites, its estimated density of 0.1 g/cm³ was much lower than would be expected of a natural object as even water has a density of 1 g/cm³. Hence, European Space Agency astronomers have concluded that the object was likely a fuel tank of some sort. After more observations, astronomers determined that the object would impact the Earth on 13 November 2015 at 06:18 UTC (11:48 local time), south of Sri Lanka. Due to its small size, it was expected that most or all of the object would burn up in the atmosphere before impacting, but would be visible as a bright daytime fireball if the sky was not badly overcast.",astrology-astronomy,1

"Mariner 5 (Mariner Venus 1967) was a spacecraft of the Mariner program that carried a complement of experiments to probe Venus' atmosphere by radio occultation, measure the hydrogen Lyman-alpha (hard ultraviolet) spectrum, and sample the solar particles and magnetic field fluctuations above the planet. Its goals were to measure interplanetary and Venusian magnetic fields, charged particles, plasma, radio refractivity and UV emissions of the Venusian atmosphere. Mariner 5 was actually built as a backup to Mariner 4, but after the success of the Mariner 4 mission, it was modified for the Venus mission by removing the TV camera, reversing and reducing the four solar panels, and adding extra thermal insulation. Liftoff took place on June 14, 1967 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 12 on Atlas vehicle 5401. Booster performance was normal through the Atlas portion of the launch and the first Agena burn, with all systems operating at the proper level. During the second Agena burn, abnormal fluctuations in the engine chamber pressure occurred, however they did not preclude successful interplanetary injection. There had been several occurrences of this behavior on previous NASA and Air Force launches and a program was initiated to correct it which led to a redesign of the Agena turbopump gearbox. Mariner 5 flew by Venus on October 19 that year at an altitude of 3,990 kilometers (2,480 mi). With more sensitive instruments than its predecessor Mariner 2, Mariner 5 was able to shed new light on the hot, cloud-covered planet and on conditions in interplanetary space. Radio occultation data from Mariner 5 helped to understand the temperature and pressure data returned by the Venera 4 lander, which arrived at Venus shortly before it. After these missions, it was clear that Venus had a very hot surface and an atmosphere even denser than expected. The operations of Mariner 5 ended in November 1967 and it is now defunct in a heliocentric orbit.",astrology-astronomy,1

"20461 Dioretsa, provisional designation 1999 LD31, is a distant minor planet classified as centaur, with a highly eccentric and retrograde orbit, approximately 14 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered 8 June 1999, by members of the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) team at the U.S. Lincoln Laboratory Experimental Test Site, Socorro, New Mexico. The centaur orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.4–45.2 AU once every 116 years and 4 months (42,485 days). Its orbit has an exceptional eccentricity of 0.90 and an outstanding inclination of 160° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic (greater than 90° means retrograde). Currently, its orbit has an uncertainty parameter value of 2. The first precovery was taken at Steward Observatory (Kitt Peak–Spacewatch) in 1998, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 1 year prior to its discovery. Dioretsa's orbit is otherwise similar to that of a comet. This has led to speculation that Dioretsa was originally an object from the Oort cloud. The minor planet's name \""Dioretsa\"" is the word \""asteroid\"" spelled backwards, and is the first numbered of currently more than 20 known minor planets with a retrograde motion in the Solar System.

"The Orbiting Frog Otolith (OFO) was a NASA space program which resulted in the successful launch in 1970 of the Orbiting Frog Otolith spacecraft (OFO-A mission), sending two bullfrogs into orbit for the study of weightlessness. The name, derived through common use, was a functional description of the biological experiment carried by the satellite. Otolith referred to the frog's inner-ear balance mechanism. The Orbiting Frog Otolith Program was a part of the research program of NASA's Office of Advanced Research and Technology (OART). One of the goals of the OART was to study vestibular organ function in space and on the Earth. The OFO experiment was designed to allow researchers to collect neurophysiological data on the response of the otolith to prolonged periods of weightlessness. The otolith is a part of the inner ear that is associated with equilibrium control: acceleration with respect to gravity as its primary sensory input. The Frog Otolith Experiment (FOE) was developed by Dr. Torquato Gualtierotti of the University of Milan, Italy, when he was assigned to the Ames Research Center as a resident Research Associate sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences. The experiment was designed to study the adaptability of the otolith to sustained weightlessness, to provide information for manned space flight. Originally planned in 1966 to be included on an early Apollo mission, the experiment was deferred when that mission was canceled. In late 1967 authorization was given to orbit the FOE when a supporting spacecraft could be designed. The project, part of NASA's Human Factor Systems program, was officially designated \""OFO\"" in 1968. After a series of delays, OFO was orbited 9 November 1970. After the successful OFO-A mission in 1970, interest in the research continued. A project called Vestibular Function Research was initiated in 1975 to fly a vestibular experiment in an Earth-orbiting spacecraft. This flight project was eventually discontinued, but a number of ground studies were conducted. The research has given rise to several very useful offshoots, including the ground-based Vestibular Research Facility located at ARC. OFO should not to be confused with similar acronyms describing the Orbiting Observatory series of spacecraft, such as Orbiting Geophysical Observatory (OGO), Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO), and Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO).",astrology-astronomy,1

"NGC 4676, or the Mice Galaxies, are two spiral galaxies in the constellation Coma Berenices. About 290 million light-years away, they began the process of colliding and merging about 290 million years ago. Their name refers to the long tails produced by tidal action—the relative difference between gravitational pulls on the near and far parts of each galaxy—known here as a galactic tide.Members of the Coma cluster, it is a possibility that both galaxies have experienced collision, and will continue colliding until they coalesce. The colors of the galaxy are peculiar. In the upper galaxy (NGC 4676A, to the right in the photo), a core with some dark markings is surrounded by a bluish white remnant of spiral arms. The tail is unusual, starting out blue and terminating in a more yellowish color, despite the fact that the beginning of each arm in virtually every spiral galaxy starts yellow and terminates in a bluish color. The lower galaxy (NGC 4676B, to the left) is closer to normal, with a yellowish core and two arcs; arm remnants underneath are bluish as well.

"Artemis is a geostationary earth orbit satellite (GEOS) for telecommunications, built for ESA. The Artemis satellite operates at the 21.5E orbital position. The mission was planned for many years, with launch initially intended for 1995 and slipping; it was intended for launch on Ariane 5 but at one point there were suggestions that a Japanese H-II rocket might be used. Launched by an Ariane 5 rocket on 12 July 2001, it originally reached an orbit much lower than planned (590 km x 17487 km) due to a malfunction in the launch vehicle's upper stage. It was remotely reconfigured to reach its intended station by means of a novel procedure. First, over the course of about a week, most of its chemical fuel was used to put it in a 31,000 km circular orbit (by raising first the apogee then the perigee, going via a 590 km x 31000 km orbit). Then, its electric-ion motor — originally intended for station keeping and for firing a few minutes at a time — was instead kept running for most of 18 months, pushing the spacecraft into an outward spiral trajectory. It gained altitude at the rate of about 15 km per day, until it reached the intended geostationary orbit.

"69230 Hermes is an Apollo, Mars- and Venus-crosser binary asteroid that passed Earth at about twice the distance of the Moon on October 30, 1937. It is named after the Greek god Hermes. At the time, this was the closest known approach of an asteroid to the Earth. Not until 1989 was a closer approach (by 4581 Asclepius) observed. At closest approach, Hermes was moving 5° per hour across the sky and reached 8th magnitude. It was discovered by Karl Reinmuth in images taken at Heidelberg Observatory on October 28, 1937. Only four days of observations could be made before Hermes became too faint to be seen in the telescopes of the day. This was not enough to calculate an orbit, and Hermes was \""lost\"" (see Lost asteroids). It thus did not receive a number, but Reinmuth nevertheless named it after the Greek god Hermes. It was the only unnumbered but named asteroid, having only the provisional designation 1937 UB. On October 15, 2003, Brian A. Skiff of the LONEOS project made an asteroid observation that, when the orbit was calculated backwards in time (by Timothy B. Spahr, Steven Chesley and Paul Chodas), turned out to be a rediscovery of Hermes. The orbit is now well known, and Hermes has been assigned sequential number 69230. In retrospect it turned out that Hermes came even closer to the Earth in 1942 than in 1937, within 1.7 Moon distances, without being observed. On October 30, 1937, it passed 0.00494 AU (739,000 km; 459,000 mi) from the Earth and on April 26, 1942, it passed 0.0042415 AU (634,520 km; 394,270 mi) from Earth. Hermes is an S-type asteroid, a classification first reported by Andy Rivkin and Richard Binzel. Radar observations led by Jean-Luc Margot at Arecibo Observatory and Goldstone in October and November 2003 showed Hermes to be a binary asteroid.

"Andromeda I is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy(dSph) about 2.40 million light-years away in the constellation Andromeda. Andromeda I is part of the Local group of galaxies and a satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). It is roughly 3.5 degrees south and slightly east of M31. As of 2005, it is the closest known dSph companion to M31 at an estimated projected distance of ~40 kpc or ~150,000 light-years. Andromeda I was discovered by Sidney van den Bergh in 1970 with the Mount Palomar Observatory 48-inch telescope. Further study of Andromeda I was done by the WFPC2 camera of the Hubble Space Telescope. This found that the horizontal branch stars, like other dwarf spheroidal galaxies were predominantly red. From this, and the abundance of blue horizontal branch stars, along with 99 RR Lyrae stars detected in 2005, lead to the conclusion there was an extended epoch of star formation. The estimated age is approximately 10 Gyr. The Hubble telescope also found a globular cluster in Andromeda I, being the least luminous galaxy where such a cluster was found.",astrology-astronomy,1

"The International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) was an astronomical observatory satellite primarily designed to take ultraviolet spectra. The satellite was a collaborative project between NASA, the UK Science Research Council and the European Space Agency (ESA). The mission was first proposed in early 1964, by a group of scientists in the United Kingdom, and was launched on January 26, 1978 aboard a NASA Delta rocket. The mission lifetime was initially set for 3 years, but in the end it lasted almost 18 years, with the satellite being shut down in 1996. The switch-off occurred for financial reasons, while the telescope was still functioning at near original efficiency. It was the first space observatory to be operated in real time by astronomers who visited the groundstations in the United States and Europe. Astronomers made over 104,000 observations using the IUE, of objects ranging from solar system bodies to distant quasars. Among the significant scientific results from IUE data were the first large scale studies of stellar winds, accurate measurements of the way interstellar dust absorbs light, and measurements of the supernova SN1987A which showed that it defied stellar evolution theories as they then stood. When the mission ended, it was considered the most successful astronomical satellite ever.",astrology-astronomy,1

NGC 3227 is an intermediate spiral galaxy that is interacting with the dwarf elliptical galaxy NGC 3226. The two galaxies are one of several examples of a spiral with a dwarf elliptical companion that are listed in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. Both galaxies may be found in the constellation Leo. Sir William Herschel already recognised them as a 'double nebula' and they were jointly listed as Holm 187 in the Catalogue of Double and Multiple Galaxies and as Arp 94 in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. Amateur telescopes can discern them but require magnification of about 100 times. They are situated 50′ east of the well-known double star system Gamma Leonis (i.e. Algieba).,astrology-astronomy,1
"NGC 4030 is a grand design spiral galaxy located about 64 million light years away in the constellation Virgo. With an apparent visual magnitude of 10.6, it is visible with a small telescope as a 3 arc minute wide feature about 4.75° to the southeast of the star Beta Virginis. It is inclined by an angle of 47.1° to the line of sight from the Earth and is receding at a velocity of 1,465 km/s. The morphological classification of NGC 4030 in the De Vaucouleurs system is SA(s)bc, which indicates a spiral structure (SA) with no bar (s) and moderate to loosely wound arms (bc). The inner part of the galaxy shows a complex structure with multiple spiral arms, which becomes a symmetric, double arm pattern beyond 49″ from the core. The central bulge is relatively young with an estimated age of two billion years, while the nucleus is inactive. In 2007, a supernova explosion was discovered in the galaxy from images taken on February 19 from the 1 m Swope telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. Designated SN 2007aa, it was a type IIP supernova positioned 68″.5 north and 60″.8 east of the galactic nucleus.

"3771 Alexejtolstoj, provisional designation 1974 SB3, is a stony Flora asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 20 September 1974, by Russian–Ukrainian astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravleva at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj on the Crimean peninsula. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,212 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and is inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic. The first time this asteroid was observerd at Heidelberg Observatory in 1954. However, the observation was not used to extend the body's observation arc. A fragmentary rotational light-curve was obtained from photometric observation made at the Palomar Transient Factory in California in December 2011. The light-curve gave a provisional rotation period of 11.0942±0.0116 hours with a low brightness amplitude of 0.08 in magnitude (U=1). The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 – derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of its orbital family – and calculates a diameter of 3.7 kilometers.

"32008 Adriángalád, provisional designation 2000 HM53, is a binary Flora asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 3 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by LINEAR at Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site on 29 April 2000. The stony S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 3 months (1,185 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Steward Observatory (Kitt Peak) in 1991, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 9 years prior to its discovery. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) assumes an albedo of 0.24 – derived from 8 Flora, the family's largest member and namesake – and calculates a diameter of 3.07 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 14.73. A rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec at Ondřejov Observatory in August 2007. The light-curve gave a well-defined rotation period of 3.0171 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.19 in magnitude (U=3). During the photometric observations it was revealed that Adriángalád is a binary system, with an asteroid moon orbiting it every 40.24±0.02 hours. The moon's size is estimated to measure about 40% of that of its primary, which would give it a diameter of 1.2 kilometers based on CALL's calculations. The minor planet is named after Slovak astronomer Adrián Galád (b. 1970) a discoverer of minor planets and several binary asteroids himself. He is well known for his photometric observations at both Ondřejov and Modra Observatory. Naming citation was published (M.P.C. 100607).",astrology-astronomy,1

"1621 Druzhba, provisional designation 1926 TM, is a stony asteroid and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 9 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Russian astronomer Sergey Belyavsky at the Crimean Simeiz Observatory on 1 October 1926. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0–2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,216 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.12 and is tilted by 3 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has an albedo between 0.2 and 0.3, based on the surveys carried out by IRAS, Akari, and WISE/NEOWISE. Photometric observations made in 2006 at the Oakley Observatory in Terre Haute, Indiana, found a light curve period of 47.9±0.5 hours, with variation in brightness of less than one magnitude. In 2010, observations were made at the Goat Mountain Astronomical Research Station in Rancho Cucamonga, California, gave a period estimate of 47.9 hours, although this may be a half rotation period instead (99.2 hours). The long rotation period makes accurate estimates more difficult to obtain, so further data is needed to reduce the margin of error.

The metallic X-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0–3.3 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,576 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.25 and is tilted by 15 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. A photometric observation of the asteroid's light-curve performed at the Palmer Divide Observatory during 1999 rendered a rotation period of 5.892±0.002 hours with a brightness variation of 0.57 magnitude.

"1685 Toro, provisional designation 1948 OA, is an eccentric asteroid classified as near-Earth object, about 4 kilometers in diameter. It is also an Apollo asteroid, a subgroup of near-Earth asteroids that cross the orbit of Earth. It was discovered by American astronomer Carl A. Wirtanen at Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton, California on 17 July 1948. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.8–2.0 AU once every 1.60 years (584 days). Its orbit shows a very high eccentricity of 0.44 and is tilted by 9 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. The stony S-type asteroid is reported to be composed of L chondrite with a high geometric albedo in the range of 0.24–0.34. It has an extremely well-measured rotation period of 10.2 hours. Its orbit also shows a 5:8 resonance with Earth and in a near 5:13 resonance with Venus. It was the third Apollo asteroid to be discovered. The current resonance with Earth will last for only a few thousand years. Calculations show that Toro will leave it in 2960 AD, and that it will enter the region of 5:13 resonance with Venus in 3470. This is because the distance from Earth's orbit will become larger and that from Venus's orbit smaller. A study of long-term stability shows that the alternating resonances will possibly be broken roughly 3 million years from now because of close approaches between Toro and Mars. Based on orbital paths, Toro is the best candidate for the source of the Sylacauga meteorite, the first meteorite authenticated to have struck a human, Mrs. Ann Hodges of Sylacauga, Alabama on 30 November 1954. Toro's Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of 0.0509 AU (7,610,000 km; 4,730,000 mi), is just above the 0.05-AU requirement to be listed as a potentially hazardous asteroid. With an orbital uncertainty of 0, its orbit and future close approaches are well determined.

Herrick had studied the asteroid's orbit, and requested the name, along with the other asteroid, 1580 Betulia.",astrology-astronomy,1

"Umbriel is a moon of Uranus discovered on October 24, 1851, by William Lassell. It was discovered at the same time as Ariel and named after a character in Alexander Pope's poem The Rape of the Lock. Umbriel consists mainly of ice with a substantial fraction of rock, and may be differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. The surface is the darkest among Uranian moons, and appears to have been shaped primarily by impacts. However, the presence of canyons suggests early endogenic processes, and the moon may have undergone an early endogenically driven resurfacing event that obliterated its older surface. Covered by numerous impact craters reaching 210 km (130 mi) in diameter, Umbriel is the second most heavily cratered satellite of Uranus after Oberon. The most prominent surface feature is a ring of bright material on the floor of Wunda crater. This moon, like all moons of Uranus, probably formed from an accretion disk that surrounded the planet just after its formation.

"971 Alsatia, provisional designation 1921 LF, is a large, carbonaceous asteroid from the middle region of the asteroid belt, about 64 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by French astronomer Alexandre Schaumasse at Nice Observatory in southeastern France, on 23 November 1921. The dark C-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.2–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,568 days). Although the asteroid is of carbonaceous rather than silicaceous composition, the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link classifies it as a member of the Eunomia family, a large group of otherwise S-type asteroids and the most prominent family in the intermediate main-belt. Its orbit is tilted by 14 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows an eccentricity of 0.16. Several concurring photometric light-curve analysis rendered a well-defined rotation period of 9.6 hours. The body has an albedo between 0.04 and 0.05, according to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission. The minor planet was named after the French province Alsace (regained from Germany after the First World War) in northeast France between the Rhine river and the Vosges mountains. In 1922, the discoverer proposed the name Alsace. However, the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut, then responsible for the naming of minor planets, changed the name in Alsatia.

"33 Polyhymnia is a main belt asteroid that was discovered by French astronomer Jean Chacornac on October 28, 1854 and named after Polyhymnia, the Greek Muse of sacred hymns. Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico during 2008 gave a light curve with a period of 18.609 ± 0.002 hours and a brightness variation of 0.15 ± 0.02 in magnitude. This result is in good agreement with a previous study performed during 1980. These results were re-examined with additional observations in 2011, yielding a refined estimate of 18.608 ± 0.001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.18 ± 0.02 magnitude. Due to its high eccentricity (0.338), one of the highest for a lower numbered minor planet, on rare close approaches it can reach tenth magnitude, as on September 8, 2014 when it will be apparent magnitude 9.9 and 0.894 AU from Earth. The orbit of 33 Polyhymnia puts it in a 22:9 mean motion resonance with the planet Jupiter. The computed Lyapunov time for this asteroid is 10,000 years, indicating that it occupies a chaotic orbit that will change randomly over time because of gravitational perturbations of the planets. Measurements of the position for this asteroid from 1854 to 1969 were used to determination the gravitational influence of Jupiter upon 33 Polyhymnia. This yields an inverse mass ratio of 1,047.341 ± 0.011 for Jupiter relative to the sun. Polyhymnia has been studied by radar.",astrology-astronomy,1

"Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Mission (MAVEN) is a space probe developed by NASA designed to study the Martian atmosphere while orbiting Mars. Mission goals include determining how the planet's atmosphere and water, presumed to have once been substantial, were lost over time. MAVEN was successfully launched aboard an Atlas V launch vehicle at the beginning of the first launch window on November 18, 2013. Following the first engine burn of the Centaur second stage, the vehicle coasted in low Earth orbit for 27 minutes before a second Centaur burn of five minutes to insert it into a heliocentric Mars transit orbit. On September 22, 2014, MAVEN reached Mars and was inserted into an areocentric elliptic orbit 6,200 km (3,900 mi) by 150 km (93 mi) above the planet's surface. The principal investigator for the spacecraft is Bruce Jakosky of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder. On 5 November 2015, NASA announced that data from MAVEN shows that the deterioration of Mars’ atmosphere increases significantly during solar storms. That loss of atmosphere to space likely played a key role in Mars' gradual shift from its carbon dioxide-dominated atmosphere - which had kept Mars relatively warm and allowed the planet to support liquid surface water - to the cold, arid planet seen today.

It was discovered on 17 May 1991, by American astronomer couple Carolyn and Eugene Shoemaker at the U.S Palomar Observatory in California. The dark C-type asteroid resides in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's L4 Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of the gas giant's orbit (also see Trojans in astronomy). It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.6–5.8 AU once every 11 years and 11 months (4,340 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 34° with respect to the ecliptic. The first used precovery was taken at the discovering observatory in 1989, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 2 years prior to its discovery. Photometric observations of this asteroid by astronomers Stefano Mottola and Anders Erikson with the Dutch 0.9-metre telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory site in northern Chile during June 1994 were used to build a light curve. It showed a rotation period of 9.518±0.013 hours with a brightness variation of 0.34 ± 0.02 magnitude (U=3-). In May 2015, another rotational light-curve was obtained by Robert Stephens at the Center for Solar System Studies, California, using the Víctor M. Blanco Telescope. The light-curve rendered a concurring period of 9.540±0.007 hours with an amplitude of 0.20 in magnitude (U=3-). According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures between 68.5 and 81.4 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.04 and 0.07. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link agrees with the results obtained by IRAS, and derives an albedo of 0.06 with a diameter of 73.4 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 9.3. The minor planet was named after Telephus from Greek mythology. He is the grandson of Zeus and son of Heracles, after whom the Apollo near-Earth asteroids 5731 Zeus and 5143 Heracles are named, respectively. Telephus was the son-in-law of King Priam of Troy, but fought with the Greeks in the Trojan war. Naming citation was published on 12 July 1995 (M.P.C. 25444).",astrology-astronomy,1

The two person crew stayed were in space for a record setting 96 days, from December 1977 to March 1978. The expedition was the start of what would be the semi-permanent occupation of space by the Soviets. The expedition set several records and established several milestones, including the longest space flight to that time, the first docking of three spacecraft together, and the hosting of the first non-Soviet, non-American space-farer. Additionally, the mission saw the first spacewalk by the Soviets since 1969. An important modification from previous Salyut stations which made many of these feats possible was an extra docking port on Salyut 6, which allowed for re-supply missions, visiting crews and, potentially, crew rotations and permanent occupation. The crew consisted of Yuri Romanenko and Georgi Grechko. Their call sign for the mission was Taymyr, after the Russian peninsula.

Attempts to produce a light curve for this object have yielded differing synodic rotation periods, perhaps in part because the period is close to half an Earth day. Observations suggest that the pole of rotation is near the orbital plane, yielding only small light variations during certain parts of each orbit. Attempts to observe the asteroid photometrically during an optimal viewing period of the object's orbit gave a rotation period of 11.7922 ± 0.0001 h with an amplitude variation of 0.53 ± 0.05 in magnitude.",astrology-astronomy,1

"78816 Caripito, provisional designation 2003 PZ9, is an asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, roughly 5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 4 August 2003, by American amateur astronomer and professor of geophysics, Joseph Dellinger, at the U.S. Needville Observatory, Texas. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.4–3.8 AU once every 5 years and 7 months (2,032 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.23 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Palomar's Digitized Sky Survey in 1953, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 50 years prior to its discovery. As of 2016, the asteroid's effective size, its composition and albedo, as well as its rotation period and shape remain unknown. Based on an absolute magnitude of 15.4, the asteroid is calculated to measure between 2 and 5 kilometers in diameter, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25. Since asteroids in the outer main-belt are mostly of a carbonaceous rather than of a silicaceous composition, with low albedos, typically around 0.06, the asteroid's diameter might be on the upper end of NASA's published conversion table, as the lower the body's reflectivity (albedo), the larger its diameter, for a given absolute magnitude (brightness). This minor planet is named for the Venezuelan town of Caripito in the northeastern Monagas State. It was the place where the parents of the discoverer, Thomas Baynes Dellinger (b. 1926) and María de la Garza Cantú (b. 1928), met in 1949. At the time, the town was a base camp for the country's rich Quiriquire oil field. Naming citation was published on 18 September 2005 (M.P.C. 54829).",astrology-astronomy,1
"2995 Taratuta, provisional designation 1978 QK, is a stony asteroid from the middle region of the asteroid belt, about 17 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 31 August 1978, by Russian astronomer Nikolai Chernykh at Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj on the Crimean peninsula. The asteroid is a member of the Eunomia family, a large group of S-type asteroids and the most prominent family in the intermediate main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.3–3.0 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,546 days). Its orbit is tilted by 15 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows an eccentricity of 0.14. In 2014, a photometric light-curve analysis performed at the U.S. Burleith Observatory in Washington D.C. gave the body a revised rotation period of 11.1 hours, while a previous observation measured a much shorter period of 6.6 hours. The asteroid's geometric albedo of 0.06–0.07 has been determined by the space-satellites IRAS and Akari, with the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link deriving a somewhat higher value of 0.09. For a S-type asteroid, this is still an exceptionally low albedo. The minor planet was named in honor of Evgeniya Aleksandrovna Taratuta, Soviet writer and literary scholar.",astrology-astronomy,1

"4797 Ako, provisional designation 1989 SJ, is a stony Nysian asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by the Japanese astronomers Toshiro Nomura and Kōyō Kawanishi at the Minami-Oda Observatory, Japan, on 30 September 1989. The S-type asteroid is a member of the stony subgroup of the main-belt's Nysa family, which is named after its largest member 44 Nysa. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0–2.9 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,368 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.18 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1978, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 11 years prior to its discovery. A rotational light-curve of this asteroid was obtained for the first time from photometric observations made at the U.S. Ricky Observatory, Missouri, in November 2008. It gave a well-defined rotation period of 4.085±0.001 hours with a relatively high brightness variation of 0.90 in magnitude (U=3), indicative of a non-spheroidal shape. According to NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures 6.0 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.11, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.21, and calculates a diameter of 4.0 kilometers, as the higher the albedo (reflectivity), the smaller the body's diameter, at a constant absolute magnitude (brightness). The minor planet was named for the city of Akō in the Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, and for its ancient castle on the Seto Inland Sea. Known for its salt production, the city is the birthplace of the fictional account of Chūshingura, a tale about the forty-seven Ronin who committed seppuku after avenging their master.

"2010 XC15 (also written 2010 XC15) is an Aten near-Earth asteroid and potentially hazardous object. It has an observation arc of 2 years and an Uncertainty Parameter of 2. It was discovered on 5 December 2010 by the Catalina Sky Survey at an apparent magnitude of 17.5 using a 0.68-metre (27 in) Schmidt. Based on an absolute magnitude of 21.4, the asteroid has an estimated diameter of about 200 metres (660 ft). 2010 XC15 is noted for a close approach to Earth on 27 December 1976 at a distance of about 0.0062 AU (930,000 km; 580,000 mi). As of November 2011 with an observation arc of 40 days, the JPL Small-Body Database showed that the uncertainty region of the asteroid during the 1976 close approach could result in a pass anywhere from 0.001 AU to 0.018 AU from Earth.

"The Gravity and Extreme Magnetism SMEX (GEMS) mission was a cancelled space observatory mission. The main scientific goal of GEMS was to be the first mission to systematically measure the polarization of cosmic X-Ray sources. GEMS would have provided data to help scientists study the shape of space that has been distorted by a spinning black hole's gravity and the structure and effects of the magnetic fields around Neutron stars. It was cancelled by NASA in June 2012 for potential cost overruns due to delays in developing the technology. GEMS was managed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA, the United States space agency, at the Goddard Space Flight Center. The project was an astrophysics program reporting to NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) in Washington, D.C..

"3192 A'Hearn, provisional designation 1982 BY1, is a carbonaceous asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 6 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station in Flagstaff, Arizona, on 30 January 1982. The C-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0–2.8 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,338 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.17 and is tilted by 3 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was obtained at El Leoncito in 1975, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 7 years prior to its discovery. A rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations made by Japanese astronomer Sunao Hasegawa, using the 1.05-meter Schmidt telescope at Kiso Observatory in March 2004. It showed a well-defined rotation period of 3.16 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.20 in magnitude (U=3). The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.20 – an unusually high value for a carbonaceous body, otherwise known for their low albedos, typically around 0.06 – and calculates a diameter of 5.7 kilometers. The minor planet was named for American cometary astronomer and professor of astronomy at CMNS, Michael A'Hearn (b. 1940), known for his contribution to cometary science, especially for his wide-range spectroscopic and spectrophotometric observations. He participated in the space-based EPOXI and IUE mission, which, in 1983, detected for the first time the presence of cometary diatomic sulfur while observing Comet IRAS–Araki–Alcock's spectrum.

"IC 10 is an irregular galaxy in the constellation Cassiopeia. It was discovered by Lewis Swift in 1887 and in 1935 Nicholas Mayall became the first to suggest that the object is extragalactic. Edwin Hubble suspected it might belong to the Local Group of galaxies, but its status remained uncertain for decades. The radial velocity of IC 10 was measured in 1962, and it was found to be approaching the Milky Way at approximately350 km/s, strengthening the evidence for its membership in the Local Group. Its membership in the group was finally confirmed in 1996 by direct measurements of itsdistance based on observations of Cepheids. Despite its closeness, the galaxy is rather difficult to study because it lies near the plane of the Milky Way and is therefore heavily obscured by interstellar matter. The apparent distance between IC 10 and the Andromeda Galaxy is about the same as the apparent distance between the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy, which suggests that IC 10 may belong to the M31 subgroup. IC 10 is the only known starburst galaxy in the Local Group of galaxies. It has many more Wolf-Rayet stars per square kiloparsec (5.1 stars/kpc²) than the Large Magellanic Cloud (2.0 stars/kpc²) or the Small Magellanic Cloud (0.9 stars/kpc²). Although the galaxy has a luminosity similar to the SMC, it is considerably smaller. Its higher metallicity compared to the SMC suggests that star formation activity has continued for a longer time period. The evolutionary status of the Wolf-Rayet stars suggests that they all formed in a relatively short timespan. The ratio between the two types of Wolf-Rayet stars (WC stars and WN stars) in IC 10 is very different from the ratio in other galaxies in the Local Group, which may be somehow due to the starburst nature of the galaxy. Currently the galaxy produces stars at the rate of 0.04–0.08 solar masses per year, which means that the gas supply in the galaxy can last for only a few billion years longer. Observations of IC 10 in the far-infrared show that the dust in this mild starburst galaxy is deficient in small grains. It is hypothesized that any small grains that formerly existed were destroyed by strong ultraviolet radiation in the areas around the hot luminous stars that were formed in the galaxy's recent burst of star formation. The galaxy has a huge envelope of hydrogen gas, with an apparent size measuring 68′ × 80′, which is far larger than the apparent size of the galaxy in visible light (5.5′ × 7.0′). IC 10 is also unusual in the respect that the visible part of the galaxy seems to rotate in a different direction than the outer envelope. It has a H II nucleus.",astrology-astronomy,1
"Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977. Part of the Voyager program to study the outer Solar System, Voyager 1 launched 16 days after its twin, Voyager 2. Having operated for 39 years, 5 months and 2 days, the spacecraft still communicates with the Deep Space Network to receive routine commands and return data. At a distance of 135 AU (2.02×1010 km) from the Sun as of June 2016, it is the farthest spacecraft from Earth. The probe's primary mission objectives included flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's large moon, Titan. While the spacecraft's course could have been altered to include a Pluto encounter by forgoing the Titan flyby, exploration of the moon, which was known to have a substantial atmosphere, took priority. It studied the weather, magnetic fields, and rings of the two planets and was the first probe to provide detailed images of their moons. After completing its primary mission with the flyby of Saturn on November 20, 1980, Voyager 1 began an extended mission to explore the regions and boundaries of the outer heliosphere. On August 25, 2012, Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause to become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space and study the interstellar medium.

"Venera 2MV-1 No.1, also known as Sputnik 19 in the West, was a Soviet spacecraft, which was launched in 1962 as part of the Venera programme, and was intended to become the first spacecraft to land on Venus. Due to a problem with its upper stage it failed to leave low Earth orbit, and reentered the atmosphere a few days later. It was the first of two Venera 2MV-1 spacecraft, both of which failed to leave Earth orbit. Venera 2MV-1 No.1 was launched at 02:18:45 UTC on 25 August 1962, atop a Molniya 8K78 carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The first three stages of the rocket operated nominally, injecting the fourth stage and payload into a low Earth orbit. The fourth stage then coasted until one hour and fifty seconds after launch, when it fired its ullage motors in preparation for ignition. One of the ullage motors failed to fire, and when the main engine ignited for a four-minute burn to place the spacecraft into heliocentric orbit, the stage began to tumble out of control. Forty-five seconds later, its engine cut off, leaving the spacecraft stranded in Earth orbit. It reentered the atmosphere on 28 August 1962, three days after it had been launched. The designations Sputnik 23, and later Sputnik 19 was used by the United States Naval Space Command to identify the spacecraft in its Satellite Situation Summary documents, since the Soviet Union did not release the internal designations of its spacecraft at that time, and had not assigned it an official name due to its failure to depart geocentric orbit.",astrology-astronomy,1

The bright S-type asteroid is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–2.2 AU once every 2 years and 10 months (1,022 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 25° with respect to the ecliptic.The first precovery was taken at the discovering observatory in 1955, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 32 years prior to its discovery. In September 2015, a rotational light-curve was obtained for this asteroid from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at the Palmer Divide Station, Colorado. It gave a well-defined rotation period of 1320±10 hours with a brightness variation of 1.34 magnitude (U=3-). As of 20116, it is the 3rd slowest rotating minor planet in the Light Curve Data Base (LCDB). Also, the light-curve's high amplitude indicates that the body has a non-spheroidal shape. Brian Warner's 2015-observation supersedes a previously obtained light-curve that gave a significantly shorter period of 560±25 hours with an amplitude of 1.05 magnitude (U=2). According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a high albedo of 0.329, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for Hungaria asteroids of 0.30, and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.6. The minor planet was named in honor of American David M. Raup (1933–2015), paleontologist and expert of the fossil record at UChicago. Raup's theories contributed to the knowledge of extinction events and suggested, that the extinction of dinosaurs was part of a cycle of mass extinctions. Naming citation was published on 23 November 1999 (M.P.C. 36947).",astrology-astronomy,1
"147 Protogeneia is a large main belt asteroid that was discovered by the Hungarian astronomer Lipót Schulhof on July 10, 1875, from the Vienna Observatory; it was his only asteroid discovery. Its name is Greek for \""first born\"" and was chosen by Karl L. Littrow in allusion to the fact that this was the first asteroid discovered by an astronomer who was already known for work in other fields of astronomy. This object has a low orbital eccentricity and inclination. With an orbital period roughly double that of the planet Jupiter, it has been identified as a member of the Hecuba group of asteroids that share a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with the giant planet. Based upon its spectrum, it has a Tholen classification as a C-type asteroid, which indicates has a dark surface and probably a primitive composition of carbonaceous material. Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Altimira Observatory in 2004 gave a light curve with a period of 7.8528 ± 0.0008 hours and a brightness variation of 0.28 in magnitude. A photometric study was reported in 2006 from the Yunnan Observatory in China, finding a matching period of 7.852 hours and a brightness variation of 0.25 magnitude. They estimate the ratio of the lengths for the asteroid's major and minor axes is at least 1.26:1. There is one reported stellar occultation by Protogeneia, on May 28, 2002, from Texas.",astrology-astronomy,1

"NGC 4151 is an intermediate spiral Seyfert galaxy with weak inner ring structure located 19 megaparsecs (62 million light-years) from Earth in the constellation Canes Venatici. The galaxy was first mentioned by William Herschel on March 17, 1787; it was one of the two Seyfert galaxies described in the paper  which defined the term. It is one of the nearest galaxies to Earth to contain an actively growing supermassive black hole; it was speculated that the nucleus may host a binary black hole, with about 40 million and about 10 million solar masses respectively, orbiting with a 15.8-year period. This is, however, still a matter of active debate. Some astronomers nickname it the \""Eye of Sauron\"" from its appearance.",astrology-astronomy,1

"Sputnik 2 (Russian pronunciation: [ˈsputʲnʲɪk], Russian: Спутник-2, Satellite 2), or Prosteyshiy Sputnik 2 (PS-2, Russian: Простейший Спутник 2, Elementary Satellite 2) was the second spacecraft launched into Earth orbit, on 3 November 1957, and the first to carry a living animal, a dog named Laika. Launched by the U.S.S.R., Sputnik 2 was a 4-metre (13 foot) high cone-shaped capsule with a base diameter of 2 meters (6.6 feet) that weighed around 500 kg, though it was not designed to separate from the rocket core that brought it to orbit, bringing the total mass in orbit to 7.79 tons. It contained several compartments for radio transmitters, a telemetry system, a programming unit, a regeneration and temperature-control system for the cabin, and scientific instruments. A separate sealed cabin contained the dog Laika. Engineering and biological data were transmitted using the Tral D telemetry system, transmitting data to Earth for a 15-minute period during each orbit. Two photometers were on board for measuring solar radiation (ultraviolet and x-ray emissions) and cosmic rays. Sputnik 2 did not contain a television camera; TV images of dogs on Korabl-Sputnik 2 are commonly misidentified as Laika. Sputnik 2 was launched into space only 32 days after its predecessor Sputnik 1. Due to the huge success of Sputnik 1, Nikita Khrushchev had Sergey Korolev on orders and back to work creating a Sputnik 2 that needed to be ready for space for the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution. Many people believed that Khrushchev pushed Korolev into creating Sputnik 2 against his will and advice that it would end in failure, but actually Korolev was more than happy to comply, and he used the excitement from Sputnik 1 to help “accelerate his own plans for exploring space, particularly putting man into orbit” Sputnik 2 was part of an idea that included Sputnik 1 that came from Korolev that was approved in January 1957. At that time, it was not clear that the Soviets' main satellite plan (which would eventually become Sputnik 3) would be able to get to space because of the ongoing issues with the R-7 ICBM, which would be needed to launch a satellite of that size. “Korolev proposed substituting two “simple satellites” for the IGY satellite”. The choice to launch these two instead of waiting for the more advanced Sputnik 3 to be finished was largely motivated by the desire the launch a satellite to orbit before the US.",astrology-astronomy,1

"NGC 4402 is a relatively near, edge-on spiral galaxy located around 55 million light-years from Earth. It is in the constellation of Virgo within the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. It can be seen when viewing Markarian's Chain. NGC 4402 is roughly 55 thousand light-years wide and is moving away from Earth at around 232 kilometers per second. It is falling into the Virgo galaxy cluster. Images show evidence that the material it once contained to enable it to form stars has been stripped away in a process known as \""ram-pressure stripping\"". This is due to NGC 4402's cooler gasses being struck by hot x-ray gasses coming from the middle of the Virgo galaxy cluster as it moves toward it. The evidence is as follows: \n* There is apparent truncation of the NGC 4402's dust disk. \n* An upward bowing of the dusty disk is apparent. This is caused by a wind of hot gas. \n* Light coming from the far side of the stellar disk appears dim and reddish. This may be because pressure coming from the cluster gas is being forced between the disk and the observer. \n* The bottom part of the main disk shows dust in the form of linear filaments. These are being ablated in a characteristic \""outside-in\"" manner. The supernova SN 1976B was observed in NGC 4402 in 1976.",astrology-astronomy,1

"1414 Jérôme, provisional designation 1937 CE, is a somewhat eccentric, carbonaceous asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, about 17 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 12 February 1937 by French astronomer Louis Boyer at Algiers Observatory, Algeria, in northern Africa. The dark C-type asteroid, classified as a Ch-subtype in the SMASS classification scheme, which have a typical absorption feature in the visible red light, orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.3–3.2 AU once every 4 years and 8 months (1,697 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.16 and is tilted by 9 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has an albedo of 0.065. Although the body's diameter and albedo were measured by four observations made by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, little is known about the asteroid, with its rotation period remaining unknown, despite having a well-observed orbit with the lowest possible uncertainty, or condition code, of 0 and an observation arc that spans over a period of almost 80 years.

"6805 Abstracta, provisional designation 4600 P-L, is a carbonaceous Themistian asteroid and slow rotator from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 10 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 24 September 1960, by Dutch astronomer couple Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden, on photographic plates taken by Dutch–American astronomer Tom Gehrels at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The dark C-type asteroid is a member of the Themis family, a dynamical family of outer-belt asteroids with nearly coplanar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.7 AU once every 5 years and 8 months (2,078 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1949, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 11 years prior to its discovery. A rotational light-curve was obtained at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory from photometric observation made in September 2011. It showed an exceptionally long rotation period of 152.1834±0.8953 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.78 in magnitude (U=2). According to the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 11.9 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a low albedo of 0.09. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a typical albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.08 and calculates a somewhat smaller diameter of 8.4 kilometers. The designation \""P-L\"" stands for Palomar–Leiden, named after Palomar Observatory and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar–Leiden survey in the 1960s. Gehrels used Palomar's Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden Observatory. The trio are credited with the discovery of 4,620 minor planets. The minor planet was named for the astronomical bibliography Astronomy and Astrophysics Abstracts (AAA). Since it was founded under the auspices of the International Astronomical Union in 1969, it has systematically described, documented and indexed more than half a millions astronomical and astrophysical documents and produced more than 60 volumes. Head of AAA was German astronomer Lutz Schmadel, also known for his Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, and after whom the minor planet 2234 Schmadel is named.

"8549 Alcide, provisional designation 1994 FS, is a stony Nysa asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.2 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 30 March 1994, by a group of amateur astronomers at the Italian Farra d'Isonzo Observatory, in Farra d'Isonzo, near the border to Slovenia. The S-type asteroid is a member of the stony subgroup of the Nysa family, one of the smaller families in the main-belt, named after its namesake, 44 Nysa. The body orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0–2.9 AU once every 3 years and 10 months (1,389 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. First Precoveries were taken at Palomar and Steward Observatory (Kitt Peak) just weeks and days prior to the asteroid's discovery. A rotational light-curve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations made by astronomer David Polishook at the ground-based Wise Observatory, Israel, in November 2007. The light-curve gave a rotation period of 3 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.2 in magnitude (U=2-). According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.3 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.195, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.21 and calculates a diameter of 4.2 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 14.2. The minor planet was named for Italian high-school teacher of natural sciences, Alcide Bittesini (1913–1981). He was the father of amateur astronomer Luciano Bittesini, who co-discovered the asteroid with his amateur colleagues at the Astronomical Observatory of Farra d'Isonzo, Italy. At the age of 9, his father fostered his interest in astronomy, when they observed a comet with a homespun telescope made of a pair of glasses, a tin can and a microscope eyepiece.

"(410777) 2009 FD (also written as 2009 FD) is a binary Apollo asteroid (a class of near-Earth asteroid) with an orbit that places it at risk of a possible future collision with Earth in 2185. It has the third highest impact threat of all known asteroids on the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale based on its estimated diameter of 470 meters, kinetic yield, impact probability, and time interval. (410777) 2009 FD was initially announced as discovered on 16 March 2009 by La Sagra Sky Survey. Because there were previous observations found in images taken by the Spacewatch survey some 3 weeks prior, on 24 February 2009, the Minor Planet Center assigned the discovery credit to Spacewatch under the discovery assignment rules. (410777) 2009 FD made a close pass to Earth on 27 March 2009 at a distance of 0.004172 AU (624,100 km; 387,800 mi) and another on 24 October 2010 at 0.0702 AU. (410777) 2009 FD was recovered at apparent magnitude 23 on 30 November 2013 by Cerro Paranal Observatory, several months before the close approach of April 2014 when it passed 0.1 AU from Earth. It brightened to roughly apparent magnitude 19.3 around mid-March 2014. One radar Doppler observation of (410777) 2009 FD was made in 2014. The October–November 2015 Earth approach will be studied by the Goldstone Deep Space Network. NASA's Near Earth Program originally estimated its size to be 130 metres in diameter based on an assumed albedo of 0.15. This gave it an estimated mass of around 2,800,000 tonnes. But work by Amy Mainzer using NEOWISE data in 2014 showed that it could be as large as 472 metres with an albedo as low as 0.01. Because (410777) 2009 FD (K09F00D) was only detected in two (W1+W2) of the four wavelengths the suspected NEOWISE diameter is more of an upper limit. Radar observations in 2015 showed it to be a binary asteroid. The primary is 120–180 meters in diameter and the secondary is 60–120 meters in diameter. The JPL Small-Body Database shows that (410777) 2009 FD will make two very close approaches in the late 22nd century, with the approach of 29 March 2185 currently having a 1 in 385 chance of impacting Earth. The nominal 2185 Earth approach distance is 0.009 AU (1,300,000 km; 840,000 mi). Orbit determination for 2190 is complicated by the 2185 close approach. The precise distance that it will pass from Earth and the Moon on 29 March 2185 will determine the 30 March 2190 distance. (410777) 2009 FD should pass closer to the Moon than Earth on 29 March 2185. An impact by (410777) 2009 FD would cause severe devastation to a large region or tsunamis of significant size. Due to (410777) 2009 FD's size, and its interactions with Mars and Venus, which increase its orbital uncertainty over time, it is rated −0.40 on the Palermo Scale, placing it higher on the Sentry Risk Table than any other known object.",astrology-astronomy,1

"113390 Helvetia, provisional designation 2002 SU19, is an asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, roughly 3 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Swiss astronomer Markus Griesser at the Eschenberg Observatory in Winterthur, Switzerland, on 29 September 2002. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–2.8 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,276 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.20 and is tilted by 7 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has a well-observed orbit with the lowest possible uncertainty – a condition code of 0 – and an observation arc that spans over a period of more than half a century, as the first asteroid precovery images were already taken on photographic plates in 1960. As of 2016, the asteroid's effective size, its composition and albedo, as well as its rotation period remain unknown. Based on its absolute magnitude of 15.6, its diameter lies between 2 and 5 kilometers, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25. Since asteroids in the inner main-belt are often of a brighter silicaceous – rather than of a darker carbonaceous composition, with higher albedos, typically around 0.20, the asteroid's diameter might be on the lower end of NASA's published conversion table, as, for a given absolute magnitude, the higher the reflectivity (albedo), the smaller the body's calculated diameter. The minor planet was named in February 2006 and bears the name for Switzerland (Latin: Confoederatio Helvetica), where the asteroid was discovered. Helvetia is also an allegorical figure and symbol for the nation. Each Swiss stamp carries her name, and her figure appears on most Swiss coins.",astrology-astronomy,1

"Sputnik 41 (Russian: Спутник 41, French: Spoutnik 41), also known as Sputnik Jr 2 and Radio Sputnik 18 (RS-18), was a Franco-Russian amateur radio satellite which was launched in 1998 to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the Aéro-Club de France, and the forty-first anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite. A 4-kilogram (8.8 lb) one-third scale model of Sputnik 1, Sputnik 41 was deployed from the Mir space station on 10 November 1998. Sputnik 41 was launched aboard Progress M-40 at 04:14 UTC on 25 October 1998, along with supplies for Mir and the Znamya-2.5 reflector experiment. A Soyuz-U carrier rocket placed the spacecraft into orbit, flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan: the same launch pad used by Sputnik 1. Progress M-40 docked to Mir on 27 October, and the satellite was transferred to the space station. At about 19:30 UTC on 10 November, during an extra-vehicular activity, Sputnik 41 was deployed by cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev. On 24 November, a fortnight after deployment, Sputnik 41 was in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 339 kilometres (211 mi), an apogee of 352 kilometres (219 mi), an inclination of 51.6 degrees, and a period of 91.44 minutes. The satellite was given the International Designator 1998-062C, and was catalogued by the United States Space Command as 25533. Having ceased operations on 11 December 1998 after its batteries expired, Sputnik 41 decayed from orbit on 11 January 1999. Sputnik 41 was originally intended to be built aboard Mir, based on a satellite launched in October 1997 as a backup for Sputnik 40. That spacecraft had been stored aboard the space station for a year after the successful deployment of Sputnik 40, and it was intended that it would be fitted with upgraded electronics and deployed. By the time of launch, the project had grown to involve a complete satellite, and the Sputnik 40 backup was never deployed.",astrology-astronomy,1

"The asteroid 1620 Geographos /dʒiːoʊˈɡræfɒs/ was discovered on September 14, 1951, at the Palomar Observatory by Albert George Wilson and Rudolph Minkowski. It was originally given the provisional designation 1951 RA. Its name, a Greek word meaning \""geographer\"" (geo– 'Earth' + graphos 'drawer/writer'), was chosen to honour geographers and the National Geographic Society. Geographos is a Mars-crosser asteroid and a near-Earth object belonging to the Apollos. In 1994, during the asteroid's closest approach to Earth in two centuries at 5.0 Gm-which will not be bettered until 2586- a radar study of it was conducted by the Deep Space Network at Goldstone, California. The resultant images show Geographos to be the most elongated object in the solar system; it measures 5.1×1.8 km. Geographos is an S-type asteroid, meaning that it is highly reflective and composed of nickel-iron mixed with iron- and magnesium-silicates. Geographos was to be explored by the U.S.'s Clementine mission; however, a malfunctioning thruster ended the mission before it could approach the asteroid. 1620 Geographos is a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) because its minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) is less than 0.05 AU and its diameter is greater than 150 meters. The Earth-MOID is 0.0304 AU (4,550,000 km; 2,830,000 mi). Its orbit is well-determined for the next several hundred years.",astrology-astronomy,1
"2004 TN1 is an Apollo near-Earth asteroid and potentially hazardous object discovered on 5 October 2004 by NEAT at Mount Palomar. It has the fourth smallest geocentric Minimum Orbital Intersection Distance of any asteroid, after 2008 TC3 which exploded in Earth's atmosphere in 2008, 1994 GV, and 2014 AA which also impacted the Earth in 2014. The asteroid, however, will not make any significant close approaches to Earth in at least the next century. However, its orbit is poorly determined, with only 58 observations over 30 days between October 5 and November 4, 2004, yielding an orbital certainty of 6, with 0 being a well-determined orbit and 9 being an extremely poorly determined orbit. More observations would be needed to determine whether the asteroid may impact the earth in the next several hundred years. Absolute magnitude estimates guess the asteroid to be approximately 115–260 meters (380–850 feet) in diameter. A theoretical impact into porous rock at 45 degrees, assuming the asteroid to have a density of 2 g/cm3, would yield a crater between 1.7 and 3.2 kilometers wide, slightly larger than Meteor Crater in Arizona.",astrology-astronomy,1

"Kosmos 96 (Russian: Космос 96 meaning Cosmos 96), or 3MV-4 No.6, was a Soviet spacecraft intended to explore Venus. A 3MV-4 spacecraft launched as part of the Venera programme, Kosmos 96 was to have made a flyby of Venus, however due to a launch failure it did not depart low Earth orbit. The 3MV-4 No.6 spacecraft was originally built for a mission to Mars, with launch scheduled for late 1964. After it was not launched by the end of its launch window, the spacecraft was repurposed, along with two other spacecraft which were launched as Venera 2 and Venera 3, to explore Venus. A Molniya carrier rocket was used to launch 3MV-4 No.6. The launch occurred from Site 31/6 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 03:21 UTC on 23 November 1965. Late in third stage flight, a fuel line ruptured, causing one of the engine's combustion chambers to explode. The rocket tumbled out of control, and as a result the fourth stage, a Blok-L, failed to ignite. The spacecraft was deployed into a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 209 kilometres (130 mi), an apogee of 261 kilometres (162 mi), and 51.9 degrees of inclination to the equator. The spacecraft was named Kosmos 96, part of a series typically used for military and experimental satellites in order to cover up the failure. Had it departed Earth's orbit, it would have received the next designation in the Venera series, at the time Venera 4. Kosmos 96 was destroyed when it reentered the Earth's atmosphere on 9 December 1965. Its reentry has been suggested as a possible explanation of UFO sightings over the United States and Canada, centred on Kecksburg, Pennsylvania; however analysis found the spacecraft probably reentered several hours before the sightings.",astrology-astronomy,1

"5088 Tancredi, provisional designation 1979 QZ1, is a carbonaceous Themistian asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 15 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 22 August 1979, by Swedish astronomer Claes-Ingvar Lagerkvist at ESO's La Silla Observatory in northern Chile. The dark C-type asteroid is a member of the Themis family, a dynamical family of outer-belt asteroids with nearly coplanar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.6–3.6 AU once every 5 years and 6 months (1,997 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 1° with respect to the ecliptic. As no precoveries were taken, the asteroid's observation arc begins with its discovery observation in 1979. In February 2009, a rotational light-curve was obtained for this asteroid from photometric observations by Gonzalo Tancredi at the Los Molinos Observatory near Montevideo, Uruguay. It gave a rotation period of 5.0591±0.0001 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.31 magnitude (U=3-). According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 15.9 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.07, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.08 and calculates a diameter of 12.8 kilometers.

It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 5 months (1,258 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1954, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 38 years prior to its discovery. Although the asteroid does not cross the orbit of any planet, it does make close approaches to other large asteroids, such as 29 Amphitrite, which it approached within 0.038 AU in 1915. Further close approaches will take place in 2025 and 2135 at a distance of 0.012 and 0.009 AU, respectively. On 14 November 2009, the asteroid also made a close encounter with 3 Juno at a distance of about 0.047 AU. A rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec at the Ondřejov Observatory in June 2012. It rendered an exceptionally long rotation period of 500 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.6 in magnitude (U=2). The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24, derived from the Flora family's largest member and namesake, the asteroid 8 Flora, and calculates a diameter of 4.0 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 14.16. The minor planet was named in honor of Japanese scientist Ko Nagasawa (b. 1932), who became a keen researcher of meteors and workes for the Public Information Office at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, after retiring from the Earthquake Research Institute, University of Tokyo in 1994. At the Dodaira Station, after which the minor planet 14313 Dodaira is named, he has obtained numerous photographic spectra of the 1965-Leonid meteor shower. The minor planet's name was proposed by the second discoverer, Kazuro Watanabe, following a suggestion by Japanese astronomer Kōichirō Tomita. Naming citation was published on 20 June 1997 (M.P.C. 30099).",astrology-astronomy,1
"Soyuz 14 (Russian: Союз 14, Union 14) was a 1974 manned spaceflight to the Salyut 3 space station. Soyuz 14 is also the name given to the Soyuz spacecraft which was used to bring the cosmonauts to and from the station. The mission was part of the Soviet Union's Almaz program to evaluate the military applications of human spaceflight. The mission's crew members were cosmonauts Yuri Artyukhin and Pavel Popovich. At the time, the military nature of this mission and the station itself were not acknowledged by Soviet authorities. The flight was the first successful mission to a space station by the Soviets. The mission proved to be the only one for Salyut 3 as Soyuz 15 failed to dock with the station in August and the station was de-orbited January 1975. With the American Skylab missions now complete, the flight marked the start of the monopoly of manned space activities by the Soviets until the 1981 launch of STS 1, the first space shuttle flight, save for the joint Apollo-Soyuz flight of 1975.",astrology-astronomy,1

"Galaxy 10R was an American communications satellite which was operated by PanAmSat, and later Intelsat. It was constructed by Hughes and is based on the HS-601HP satellite bus. Launch occurred on 25 January 2000, at 01:04. The launch was contracted by Arianespace, and used an Ariane 4 42L-3 carrier rocket flying from ELA-2 at the Guiana Space Centre. Galaxy 10R was built to replace the Galaxy 10 satellite, which had been lost in a launch failure on the maiden flight of the Delta III in 1998. It was launched just fourteen months after the contract to build the satellite had been signed, due to Hughes' advance production of components to allow quick production of replacement satellites. Following its launch and on-orbit testing, it was placed in geostationary orbit at 123° West, from where it provided communications services to North America. It was expected to remain in service for fifteen years, however following a malfunction of its Xenon Ion Propulsion System in August 2004, this was reduced.

"HD 139357 b is a very massive extrasolar planet or brown dwarf located approximately 390 light years away, orbiting the 6th magnitude K-type giant star HD 139357 in the constellation of Draco. The detection occurred on March 20, 2009, which was the first day of spring. The actual mass and radius of this body remain known, but it has a minimum mass of nearly 10 times that of Jupiter and a radius of probably no more than 1.2 times Jupiter's. Most likely this is a brown dwarf rather than a planet. The reason why the object's true mass is unknown is due to the undetermined inclination of its orbital plane. Follow up observations via direct imaging may determine its radius and orbital inclination, thereby giving its density and surface gravity, which will allow a determination as to whether this object is a brown dwarf or a supermassive planet. As it is typical for supermassive planets, this orbits further from its host star than Earth is from the Sun. The planet’s year is over three Earth years. However, the orbital eccentricity of this object is much greater than Earth's: 0.1 vs. 0.017. Like most known extrasolar planets, it was detected by the wobble method, which detects planets through the circular wobbling motion of the star caused by the gravity of orbiting body.",astrology-astronomy,1

"13 Egeria is a large main-belt G-type asteroid. It was discovered by A. de Gasparis on November 2, 1850. Egeria was named by Urbain Le Verrier, whose computations led to the discovery of Neptune, after the mythological nymph Egeria of Aricia, Italy, the wife of Numa Pompilius, second king of Rome. Egeria occulted a star on January 8, 1992. Its disc was determined to be quite circular (217×196 km). On January 22, 2008, it occulted another star, and this occultation was timed by several observers in New Mexico and Arizona, coordinated by the IOTA Asteroid Occultation Program. The result showed that Egeria presented an approximately circular profile to Earth of 214.8×192 km, well in agreement with the 1992 occultation. It has also been studied by radar. In 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but the effort came up empty.

"Comet Hyakutake (Japanese pronunciation: [çʲakɯ̥take], formally designated C/1996 B2) is a comet, discovered on 31 January 1996, that passed very close to Earth in March of that year. It was dubbed The Great Comet of 1996; its passage near the Earth was one of the closest cometary approaches of the previous 200 years. Hyakutake appeared very bright in the night sky and was widely seen around the world. The comet temporarily upstaged the much anticipated Comet Hale–Bopp, which was approaching the inner Solar System at the time. Scientific observations of the comet led to several discoveries. Most surprising to cometary scientists was the first discovery of X-ray emission from a comet, believed to have been caused by ionised solar wind particles interacting with neutral atoms in the coma of the comet. The Ulysses spacecraft unexpectedly crossed the comet's tail at a distance of more than 500 million kilometres (3.3 AU or 3×108 mi) from the nucleus, showing that Hyakutake had the longest tail known for a comet. Hyakutake is a long-period comet. Before its most recent passage through the Solar System, its orbital period was about 17,000 years, but the gravitational perturbation of the giant planets has increased this period to 70,000 years.",astrology-astronomy,1
"1803 Zwicky, provisional designation 1967 CA, is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 10 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by astronomer Paul Wild at Zimmerwald Observatory near Bern, Switzerland on 6 February 1967.

"1633 Chimay, provisional designation 1929 EC, is a dark Themistian asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, about 36 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Belgian astronomer Sylvain Arend at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Uccle, on 3 March 1929. Five nights later, the body was independently discovered by Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany. The asteroid is a member of the Themis family, a dynamical family of outer-belt asteroids with nearly coplanar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.8–3.6 AU once every 5 years and 9 months (2,085 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and inclination of 3° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Heidelberg Observatory in 1917, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 12 years prior to its discovery. Several photometric light-curve analysis rendered a well-defined, concurring rotation period of 6.6 hours (U=3/3-/2). According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures between 36.1 and 37.7 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has a low albedo between 0.079 and 0.089. In accordance with the space-based surveys, the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) derives an albedo of 0.078, and calculates a diameter of 36.1 kilometers. CALL also classifies the body as a S-type rather than a carbonaceous C-type asteroid.

"1861 Komenský, provisional designation 1970 WB, is an asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, estimated to measure approximately 26 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Czech astronomer Luboš Kohoutek at the Bergedorf Observatory in Hamburg, Germany on 24 November 1970. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.8–3.2 AU once every 5 years and 3 months (1,916 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 10° with respect to the ecliptic. It has a well-observed orbit with the lowest possible uncertainty, a condition code of 0, and an observation arc that spans over a time period of almost half a century. As of 2016, the asteroid's effective size, its composition and albedo, as well as its rotation period and shape remain unknown. Based on an absolute magnitude of 16.7, the asteroid is calculated to measure between 14 and 28 kilometers in diameter, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25. Since most asteroids in the outer main-belt are of a carbonaceous rather than of a silicaceous composition, with low albedos, typically around 0.06, the asteroid's diameter might be on the lower end of NASA's published conversion table, as the higher the body's reflectivity (albedo), the smaller its diameter, for a given absolute magnitude (brightness).

"NGC 660 is a peculiar and unique polar-ring galaxy located approximately 45 million light years from Earth in the Pisces constellation. It is the only such galaxy having, as its host, a \""late-type lenticular galaxy\"". It was probably formed when two galaxies collided a billion years ago. However, it may have first started as a disk galaxy that captured matter from a passing galaxy. This material could have, over time, become \""strung out\"" to form a rotating ring. The ring is not actually polar, but rather has an inclination from the plane of the host disk of approximately 45 degrees. The extreme number of pinkish star-forming areas that occurs along the galaxy's ring could be the result of the gravitation interaction caused by this collision. The ring is 50,000 light-years across - much broader than the disk itself - and has a greater amount of gas and star formation than the host ring. This likely indicates a very violent formation. The polar ring contains objects numbering in the hundreds. Many of these are red and blue supergiant stars. The most recently created stars in the ring were just formed approximately 7 million years ago. This indicates that the formation of these stars has been a long process and is still occurring. Data about the dark matter halo of NGC 660 can be extracted by observing the gravitational effects of the dark matter on the disk and ring's rotation. From the core of the disk, radio waves are being emitted. The source of these waves is an area only 21 light years across. This may indicate the presence of a super-cluster of stars located within an area of cloud of gas.The region in the centre has a vast amount of star formation, so luminous that it is considered to be a starburst galaxy. Late in 2012, this polar-ring galaxy produced an enormous outburst having a magnitude of approximately ten times brighter than a supernova explosion. The cause is not certain, but this event may have resulted from a tremendous jet being emenating from galaxy's central black hole.",astrology-astronomy,1

"The Sepulveda Dam is a project of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers designed to withhold winter flood waters along the Los Angeles River. Completed in 1941, at a cost of $6,650,561, it is located south of center in the San Fernando Valley, approximately eight miles east of the river's source in the western end of the Valley, in Los Angeles, California. Sepulveda Dam, along with Hansen Dam located in the north San Fernando Valley, was constructed in response to the historic 1938 floods which killed 144 people. Sepulveda Dam was placed at what was at the time, the current edge of the city. East of the dam the river was crowded into a narrow bottom by the city's growth. One legacy of Sepulveda Dam is its flood control basin, a large and undeveloped area in the center of the Valley, used mostly for wildlife refuge and recreation. But another legacy of the 1938 Los Angeles River flood was the post-WWII channelization of all the Valley's dry washes, which along with the post-WWII rapid suburbanization left the Valley with hot, dry, concrete-lined river bottoms instead of greenbelts. Although now, in part, these are being devolved as interconnecting bike paths. Behind the dam, the Sepulveda Basin is home to several large recreation areas including Woodley Park, a model aircraft field, The Japanese Garden, a wildlife refuge, a water reclamation plant, and an armory. The Basin is kept free of urban over-building so that water can build up there during a prospective hundred-year flood. It is an often-used location for car commercials.",engineering,3

"The Alarcón Dam (Spanish: Presa de Alarcón, Pantano de Alarcón, or Embalse de Alarcón) is a gravity dam on the upper course of the Júcar River. It is located 6 kilometers (4 miles) from Alarcón, in the province of Cuenca, in the autonomous community of Castilla-La Mancha, Spain. The reservoir formed by the dam has a water capacity of 1,112 cubic hectometers3 (901,513 acre-feet) and spans a surface area of 6,840 hectares (26 square miles). All together, its drainage basin measures 3,033 km2 (1,171 mi2). The dam houses a hydroelectric power plant with an installed power capacity of 56 MW. The Tagus-Segura Water Transfer, which links two other major rivers, joins the reservoir briefly on its journey south, entering at the northern tail end and mixing its waters with the Júcar. Construction of the dam began in 1941 through the efforts of Valencian farmers who wanted to stabilize the flow of the river, as irrigation in the province of Valencia depends on that supply of water. This initiative is unique in Spanish history because rather than the State, it was the farmers who assumed the total cost of the project, having organized under the Unidad Sindical de Usuarios del Júcar (USUJ, Júcar Users' Coalition), an alliance of irrigation communities. Beneath the waters of the Alarcón Reservoir rest the remains of the town of Gascas, which was flooded after the building of the dam.

"Mauvoisin Dam is a concrete variable radius arch dam across the Val de Bagnes on the Dranse de Bagnes stream, in the canton of Valais, Switzerland. Initial construction on the dam commenced in 1951 and was completed in 1957, with the reservoir filling by 1958. In 1991, the dam was raised to increase the capacity of the reservoir for winter storage. The dam's primary purpose is hydroelectric power generation. The eighth highest dam in the world, Mauvoisin stands 250 metres (820 ft) high and 520 metres (1,710 ft) long, with a structural volume of 2,030,000 cubic metres (2,660,000 cu yd). The impounded water behind the dam forms the 4.9-kilometre (3.0 mi) Lac de Mauvoisin, which has a capacity of 211.5 million m3 (171,500 acre feet) and a full surface area of 208 hectares (510 acres). The dam and reservoir control runoff from a catchment of 167 square kilometres (64 sq mi). Flood waters are released by a gated spillway with a capacity of 107 m3/s (3,800 cu ft/s). Water from the dam is fed to two hydroelectric power stations with a combined capacity of 363 megawatts (MW). Mauvoisin Dam provides a hydraulic head of 482 m (1,581 ft) to the Fionnay generating station, which can produce 138 MW from three Francis turbines. The water then drops another 1,014 m (3,327 ft) to the Riddes generating station, where it drives five Pelton turbines with a combined capacity of 225 MW. The two plants produce about 943 million kilowatt hours (KWh) each year, with Fionnay generating 278 million KWh (29.5%) and Riddes generating 665 million KWh (70.5%). Mauvoisin Dam also serves for flood prevention and sediment control. The dam helps protect the Bagnes and Rhône river valleys from glacial lake outburst floods such as ones that occurred in 1595 and 1818. During the 1960s and 1970s, Giétro Glacier adjacent to Lac de Mauvoisin threatened to produce icefalls, which could have overtopped the dam. Giétro has retreated since 1980, eliminating the threat of such an event. The dam also traps about 300,000 m3 (390,000 cu yd) of sediment each year, helping to extend the life of downstream hydroelectric plants. However, sediment accumulation also poses a threat to the dam's useful life; a project to remove sediment has been proposed but has not been implemented because of safety concerns.",engineering,3

With connections to Iceland, Nuuk Airport is also one of 6 international airports in Greenland but serves only destinations within Greenland and Iceland. International connections are made with flights to either Keflavík International Airport in Iceland or Kangerlussuaq Airport. In the early 1960s, water planes of the newly established Air Greenland landed in Nuuk Port. In 1965, the airline invested in developing a more robust fleet based on the large Sikorsky S-61 helicopter, which continued to serve the town for the next four decades, even after the construction of an airport in Nuuk capable of serving the short takeoff and landing de Havilland Canada Dash-7 aircraft, which dominated at the airport since the 1970s. The airport was constructed to serve the largest town in Greenland, yet due to space constraints at the location in a mountainous area and problems with the weather, it is unable to service large airliners or flights reaching Denmark or other countries. In connection with events are chartered aircraft or VIP flights unable to reach Nuuk. A change to a small local aircraft (normally at Kangerlussuaq) is always needed.

"Bückeburg Air Base (German: Heeresflugplatz Bückeburg, ICAO: ETHB) is located northeast of the city of Bückeburg, Lower Saxony, Germany. The airfield was built in 1946 as a RAF Station, RAF Bückeburg, serving the headquarters of the Royal Air Force Germany in Bad Eilsen. It complemented the nearby headquarters of the British Army of the Rhine in Bad Oeynhausen. During the Berlin Airlift it was one of the numerous air fields from where supply flights to Berlin were carried out. After the building of the British Forces' Joint Headquarters (JHQ) at Rheindahlen in 1954, the RAF closed the airfield at the end of the 1950s. With the foundation of the Bundeswehr in 1955, a decision was made that every branch of the Bundeswehr should have their own helicopter units, operating within the framework of the tasks designated to each branch of the armed forces. Thus, the German Army Aviation Corps was founded. The first training school, of this newly established branch of the German Army, the School of Army Aviation, was established in 1959 in Mendig but moved to its current location in Bückeburg in January 1960 and has been there ever since. Its first commanding office was Colonel Kuno Ebeling. Bückeburg Air Base is used by the German Army's School of Army Aviation as one of the bases for the practical instruction of its flying and non-flying personnel. Basic flying training of helicopter pilots of other components of the German Armed Forces also takes place at Bückeburg Air Base. Apart from the actual flight training, modern high-end flight simulators are extensively used during the training of future military helicopter pilots. Approximately 70 helicopters are permanently based at the airfield, 30 of which are used on a daily base for training. Initial training begins with the Eurocopter EC 135. During the second stage, prospective pilots are then instructed in flying the Bell UH-1D, Bölkow Bo 105, medium transport helicopters LTH NATO-HELICOPTER 90 and Sikorsky CH-53G/GS. Flying instruction on the helicopters of the type Bell UH-1D, now being phased out, and Bölkow Bo 105, takes place at Celle Air Base.

"Shihmen Dam (Chinese: 石門水壩; literally: \""Stone Gate Dam\""; also spelled Shimen or Shihman) is a major rock fill dam across the Dahan River in northern Taoyuan City. It forms the Shihmen Reservoir (石門水庫), Taiwan's third largest reservoir or artificial lake. It provides irrigation in Taoyuan, flood control for the Taipei Basin, and hydroelectricity and domestic water supply for more than three million people in northern Taiwan. Completed in 1964 after nine years of construction, Shihmen was Taiwan's first multi-purpose water project and a major step towards the island's economic independence after World War II. Year-round water releases from the dam enabled additional rice harvests and doubled Taoyuan's annual agricultural output, while the reservoir became a major tourist destination due to its scenic beauty and plentiful fisheries. However, the project was criticized for its high cost and its impact on local communities, as more than 2,000 people were displaced to make way for the reservoir. Like many other reservoirs in Taiwan, Shihmen has suffered from sedimentation, reducing its capacity by over a third. Efforts to reduce the rate of sediment accumulation, including dredging, check dam construction and watershed restoration work, have had a limited effect. This has diminished both the Shihmen Dam's capability to contain floods and provide water during droughts.",engineering,3

Construction was initiated in 1961, and despite numerous difficulties encountered during its construction, including multiple floods and a major train wreck on the rail line used to transport materials to the dam site, the embankment was topped out in 1967 and the entire project was ready for use in 1968. The dam began to generate electricity after completion of the Edward Hyatt Pump-Generating Plant, then the country's largest underground power station. Since its completion in 1968, the Oroville Dam has allocated the flow of the Feather River from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta into the State Water Project's California Aqueduct, which provides a major supply of water for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley as well as municipal and industrial water supplies to coastal Southern California, and has prevented large amounts of flood damage to the area  – more than $1.3 billion between the years of 1987 and 1999. The dam has confined fish migration up the Feather River and the controlled flow of the river as a result of the Oroville Dam has affected riparian habitat. Multiple aims at trying to counter the dam's impacts on anadromous fish have included the construction of a salmon/steelhead incubator on the river which began shortly after the dam was completed.",engineering,3

"Diablo Dam is one of three dams along the upper Skagit River in Whatcom County, Washington and part of the Skagit River Hydroelectric Project that supplies Seattle with a large proportion of its power needs. Work was begun in 1917 on a six-mile tunnel through Diablo Canyon and subsequent construction of a powerhouse. Work crews had to overcome extreme weather and mountain conditions, while Seattle City Light officials had to deal with politics and diplomacy. The dam was completed in 1930, and began generating electricity in 1936. The result was a power-generating dam that holds a reservoir known as Diablo Lake. At the time it was completed, Diablo Dam, at 389 feet, was the tallest dam in the world. Water from the dam operates two main generators, each with a capacity of 64.5 MW.

"Denis-Perron Dam (French: Barrage Denis-Perron) is a rockfill embankment dam spanning the Sainte-Marguerite River, a tributary of the lower Saint Lawrence River, in eastern Quebec, Canada. Standing 171 metres (561 ft) high and 378 metres (1,240 ft) long, the dam is the primary component of Hydro-Québec's Sainte-Marguerite 3 hydroelectric project. The dam is the second highest in Quebec and the hydraulic head afforded to its power plant is also the largest in the province. Construction on the dam began in 1994 after seven years of studies and planning. Before construction began on the dam proper, a 19-metre (62 ft) high, 160-metre (520 ft) long cofferdam was raised to divert the river through a tunnel west of the dam site. An average of 500 workers and a maximum of 1,200, most of whom lived in a construction camp that opened in January 1995, were employed at the dam site during construction. After the cutting of some 233 million board feet of lumber from the future reservoir site, the dam began to impound water in 1998 and finally reached capacity in 2001. The dam and reservoir lie in a very remote region, and an 86-kilometre (53 mi) long access road had to be built to facilitate transportation to the construction site. No area residents were displaced as a result of the remote location, but a large portion of the territory of the indigenous Innu people was flooded. In 1994, Hydro-Québec paid the local Innu CA$20.9 million as compensation. Full project completion was reached in 2002 at a cost of CA$2.4 billion, making it one of the most significant 21st century hydroelectric developments in North America. After the dam was finished, temporary facilities used during construction were dismantled to ease impact on the local environment. The main workers' camp was actually demolished in 2001, a year before the project's final completion. These areas were replanted with some six hundred thousand trees. Hydroelectricity generation began in 2003. As of 2003, the dam was projected to generate about 2.73 TWh of electricity per year, or an average output of just over 310 megawatts (MW). The dam impounds a 140 km (87 mi) long, 253 km2 (63,000-acre) reservoir with a capacity of about 12.5 km3 (10,100,000 acre·ft). Excess water is released through a set of outlet works at the base of the dam, with a capacity of 1,440 m3/s (51,000 cu ft/s), and an emergency spillway about 1 km (0.62 mi) northwest of the dam. The spillway's three gates have a total capacity of 1,875 m3/s (66,200 cu ft/s), and its outflow rejoins the river about 1 km (0.62 mi) below the base of the dam. Water is fed from the reservoir through an 8.3 km (5.2 mi) long penstock to the Sainte-Marguerite 3 generating plant, which is located underground and can produce up to 882 MW from two turbines. Hydro-Québec is in the process of adding a third unit, bringing the total generating capacity to 1,322 MW, scheduled for completion in 2014.",engineering,3

The new runways were hard-topped and became the base of the Hungarian 50th Fighter Regiment. On September 1, 1958, the Defense Ministry made the decision to reorganize the structure of the Hungarian Air Force. It was at this time that the 31st Fighter Regiment was ordered to form. Independent training within the 31st began in 1959. A quantum jump in the quality of training was the introduction of the MiG-19 in 1959, and the introduction of the MiG-21 in 1962.\"" From December 1995, it became the primary staging post for U.S. peacekeeping forces coming and going into the Balkans. It was the closest airfield to the Balkans capable of landing strategic aircraft, with good rail and road links. The base then evolved into the first site for unmanned Predator aircraft missions, a rest and recreation site for Balkan-based soldiers, a training ground for armored units and a home base for aircraft that made reconnaissance and bombing runs to stop ethnic-cleansing in Kosovo. In 1999 the airbase was used by the United States Marine Corps as a base for aircraft supporting Operation Allied Force in Kosovo. During Operation Joint Forge (1998-2004) the National Support Element (NSE) of the U.S. Army (consisting of approximately 250 U.S. Army personnel) was located at the airbase.

"Wau Airport is an airport serving Wau in Papua New Guinea. A grass runway was constructed in 1927 by Cecil Levien with the assistance of native labourers. The first landing at Wau was made on 19 April 1927 by Ernest Mustar in a De Havilland DH.37 owned by Guinea Gold Airways from Lae Airfield. The airfield was extended during the Second World War to 1500 x 100 x 4000 yards as described in 1942. Wau airfield was a rough Kunai grass airstrip 3,100 feet (940 m) in length with a 12% slope heading directly for Mount Kaindi. Aircraft could approach from the northeast only, landing uphill and taking off downhill. The mountain at the end of the runway prevented second attempts at landing and precluded extension of the strip. Pilots had to manoeuvre Dakotas under clouds and through dangerous passes, \""dodging a peak here and cloud there\"", landing at high speeds. This required good visibility, but the weather over Owen Stanley Range was characterised by frequent storms, down drafts, and mists which rose from the jungle floor. The Imperial Japanese Army sent 3,000 troops from Salamaua and Mubo along the Black Cat Track to seize Wau Airfield from the Australians. The Japanese force was known as the Okabe Detachment and was commanded by Major General Toru Okabe. The Japanese offensive was stopped by the Australian Army force known as Kanga Force in the battle of Wau.

"The Peace Dam (평화의 댐) is a South Korean dam on the Bukhan River. It was built to stave off possible catastrophic flooding should the upstream Imnam Dam in North Korea collapse, either intentionally or by accident. The dam was completed in 2005. As it stands, the dam has no reservoir, and is merely preventive. Daelim industrial Co,.Ltd, leading contractor for the Peace Dam construction project, began the construction in 2012 and will end the project in 2014. And the design company for the project is Isan. Construction began in 1987, in reaction to a perceived threat following the construction of the Imnam Dam by North Korea. The Bukhan River is a tributary of the Han River, and catastrophic scenarios foresaw a flood engulfing the South Korean capital of Seoul in case of an attack by North Korea. Construction was halted before completion, among allegations that the threat had been grossly exaggerated. Construction resumed after satellite photographs in 2002 revealed the existence of cracks in the Imnam Dam, triggering fears that it could collapse in case of heavy rains. In September 2005, North Korea released massive quantities of water without warning, causing serious flooding in South Korea.

"The Silberteich is a man-made pond and lies on the upper reaches of the Brunnenbach stream between Braunlage and Sankt Andreasberg in the Harz Mountains of Germany. Originally it was called the Andreasberger Teich or Brunnenbacher Teich, where Teich means 'pond'. Its present name (which means 'Silver Pond') was chosen quite recently to underline its attraction as a tourist destination. The pond was created in 1755 in order to supply the surrounding ore mines with water power. The Braunlage Blue Glass Factory (Braunlager Blaufarbenwerk), on the site of the present-day Waldmühle, also received its energy from the reservoir. The pond is about 300 m long with an earth dam about 8 m high. Material for the construction of the dam came from a quarry on the west bank immediately next to the embankment. The Sankt Andreasberg trail (Sankt Andreasberger Fußstieg), which used to be the shortest route between Braunlage and Sankt Andreasberg, runs along the dam crest. Meanwhile, however, the direct path from the forest pub of Rinderstall on the Oder up to the Silberteich has been largely destroyed by the National Park authorities, so that the journey today requires a detour of more than double the length. In 1760 after heavy snowfalls in the Harz there was a rapid thaw in February. During the night of 4/5 February the still new dam could no longer hold back the water. It broke and floodwaters poured into the Brunnenbach valley. The waters built up in front of the Brunnenbach Mill, forming a barrier of trees and branches they had brought down with them. The swollen waters looked for a new way out and tore through the mill. Following its rebuilding, the Silberteich was also known until about 1900 as the Neue Teich ('New Pond'). Today the pond is part of a nature reserve. A path runs along the water's edge on the eastern shore. Otherwise paths have been kept some distance away in order to create a quiet zone for flora and fauna. \n* The Andreasberger Stieg trail on the dam crest of the Silberteich dam \n* Outflow of the Silberteich into the Brunnenbach from the lake... \n* … and the stream side",engineering,3

"The Shannon hydroelectric Scheme was a major development by the Irish Free State in the 1920s to harness the power of the River Shannon. Its product, the Ardnacrusha power plant, is a hydroelectric power station which is still producing power today and is located near Ardnacrusha within County Clare approximately 2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi) from the Limerick border. It is Ireland's largest river hydroelectric scheme and is operated on a purpose built headrace connected to the River Shannon. The plant includes fish ladders so that returning fish, such as salmon, can climb the river safely past the power station. Completed within 7 years of Irish independence in 1922 at a cost which was equivalent to one fifth of the Irish state's annual budget, the plant enabled an enormous surge in demand for electricity across the country and demonstrated the ability of the new government to develop during a difficult financial period. The plant was constructed by the German company Siemens-Schuckert, although much of the design was done by Irish engineers and Ireland provided most of the labour force. The scheme involved changes to the flow of the whole river, multiple dams and bridges and the construction of a national power grid. The generating plant at Ardnacrusha is composed of three vertical-shaft Francis turbine generators (commissioned in 1929) and one vertical-shaft Kaplan turbine generator (commissioned in 1934) operating under an average head of 28.5 metres. The scheme originally was designed for six turbines, with four turbines fitted. The 85 MW of generating plant in Ardnacrusha was adequate to meet the electricity demand of the entire country in the early years. The full output equates to about 332,000 MWh generated on an annual basis. Ardnacrusha generates at 10.5 kilovolts (kV) but this is transformed to 40 kV for local distribution and to 110 kV for long distance transmission.",engineering,3

"The Don Pedro Dam, since 1971 also known as the Old Don Pedro Dam, was a dam across the Tuolumne River in Tuolumne County, California. The structure is currently flooded underneath Don Pedro Reservoir, which is formed by the New Don Pedro Dam. It was a solid concrete gravity dam that was 283 ft (86 m) high, 1,000 ft (300 m) wide, 16 ft (4.9 m) thick at the crest, and 170 ft (52 m) thick at the base. It was completed in 1923 where the Tuolumne River had carved a narrow gorge with walls of solid rock about a mile (2 km) below Don Pedro Bar. The reservoir created by this dam contained 290,400 acre·ft (358,200,000 m3) of water when full, 14.3% of today's capacity. A 15 megawatt power plant was part of the dam's original design, and two more 7500 kilowatt generators were added in 1926 for 30 megawatts total, just 15% of today's capacity.

"The dam, which creates the lake, is built for hydroelectricity generation. There is no HPP (hydroelectric power plant) installed at the dam but rather the water is taken to the Teshel HPP and then further down the Devin HPP and the Vacha River with its HPPs, dams and reservoirs (Tsankov Kamak HPP, Vacha Reservoir, Krichim Reservoir, Vacha II HPP, Krichim HPP and Vacha I HPP). Besides that, a minimum of 0.15 m3/s (0.20 cu yd/s) is constantly released for sanitation of the Dospat River riverbed where the average input to the reservoir is 7.9 m3/s (10.3 cu yd/s). The flora and fauna around the reservoir are diverse and the geography offers breathtaking sights. Old coniferous forests surround the lake. On the northern bank where the town of Sarnitsa and Krushata neighborhood are located. The terrain is hilly, with meadows and arable land available, used for grazing, potato growing and other agricultural activities. Parallel to the south bank are steep slopes covered in spruce and this bank is where most holiday cabins and hotels are located. The reservoir is rich in fish. It is stocked with perch, trout (rainbow, brown, brook), carp, European chub, common rudd, common roach, pumpkinseed, wels catfish, Danube Bleak and various members of Carassius. Trout are reared in cages within the reservoir. Most types of fishing are practiced: spinning with lures, fly fishing, and others. In the surrounding areas there are a number of other large dams, including Vacha, Golyam Beglik, Batak and Shiroka Polyana. The area offers great opportunities for recreation and tourism. Accessibility is, however, rather poor. Four main mountain roads link the reservoir to the rest of the world. One from Batak, a second from Velingrad to Sarnitsa, a third from Devin and a fourth from Gotse Delchev to the town of Dospat. The one from Batak allows accessibility to some of the other Rhodope dams along its length. It forks into two roads; one leading to the town of Dospat and the other to Sarnitsa. This road to Sarnitsa is in places very rutted and may prove a challenge to navigate. Along the south bank there runs a rough dirt track from Sarnitsa to Dospat but this is only used to access the holiday spots.",engineering,3

"Shimojishima Airport (下地島空港 Shimojishima Kūkō, (IATA: SHI, ICAO: RORS)) is located on the island of Shimojishima in Miyakojima, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. The airport, also known as Shimoji Airport, was originally built as a 'training airport' for commercial pilots, with a secondary role as a (planned) alternative landing site for intercontinental supersonic airliners. It was completed in 1971, a year before Okinawa reverted to Japanese control. It was officially opened in July 1973, initially as a private airport. The prefecture operates the airport, which has been classified as a Third Class airport (otherwise known as a Type-3) since May 1979. On July 22, 1994 Japan Transocean Air suspended flights. From 2001 onwards, the U.S. Marine Corps occasionally used the airport as a stopover point for helicopters and tanker aircraft involved in regional exercises. In 2004, there were some protests over the use of the airport as a refueling stop by USMC helicopters returning from an exercise in the Philippines. Adding to concerns were reports that the airport was being looked at in connection with a new base for units that were to be displaced by the planned relocation of the Futenma base. The airport is currently listed as a CSL (Cooperative Security Location) by the US DOD. As of 2005, the airport was in use as a training facility for Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways. The long runway makes the facility well-suited for \""touch-and-go landing\"" practice maneuvers. In the same year, the then local (Irabu Town) assembly submitted a proposal to the then Defense Agency, requesting that the JASDF take over the airport as one of their bases. In 2010, there were renewed protests against proposals to turn Shimoji Airport into a permanent USMC post. As of early 2013, serious consideration was being given to basing a detachment of JASDF F-15J fighters out of the Airport, in order to provide better air defense coverage over the Senkaku Islands.

It is thought to have been named Lake Kyle, from the Kyle farm which occupied most of the land required for the lake, which in turn was named after the Kyle district in Scotland from which pioneer of the Lowveld Tom Murray MacDougall came originally. It covers about 90 km² and was created in 1960 with the construction of the Kyle Dam on the Mutirikwe River. The dam was built to provide irrigation water to the farming estates on the lowveld to the southwest, around the town of Triangle, where the main crop has been sugar cane. Lake Kyle Recreational Park lies on the reservoir's northern shore, while there is a small recreational park on the southern shore. Great Zimbabwe national monument lies close by.

"Motor City Online was a racing massively multiplayer online video game released by Electronic Arts on October 29, 2001. The point of the game was to buy classic cars (mostly American muscle cars) ranging from 1930s to 1970s models, tune them up, and race them against other players. The game went offline on August 29, 2003 so EA Games could focus on their current online game at the time, The Sims Online. EA, however, developed a new online racing game, called Need for Speed: World. Many fans of Motor City Online consider Need for Speed: World a Spiritual successor of Motor City Online, although EA has denied any direct link between the two games. Originally conceived as part of the Need for Speed series under the title Need for Speed: Motor City, all single player elements that may have been developed for the game were discarded in favor of an online-only model. The game featured some role-playing video game elements, such as leveling up after completing tasks (e.g. winning races), and a functional, supply and demand economy for players to get involved in. Aside from EA focusing on The Sims Online, another contributing factor to MCO's demise was the game's technical setup. Lag, as with most online games, was a problem, with cars acting unpredictably during times of high latency. Falling subscription rates (from an alleged peak of 36,000) and a lack of new interest in the game eventually led to its downfall. Previous Motor City Online users were offered access to The Sims Online, Ultima Online, or Earth & Beyond.",technology,9

It was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on January 26, 2010, and for PlayStation 3 on January 18, 2011. Mass Effect 2 is the second installment of the Mass Effect series and a sequel to the original Mass Effect. The game takes place within the Milky Way galaxy during the 22nd century, where humanity is threatened by an insectoid species known as the Collectors. The player assumes the role of Commander Shepard, an elite human soldier who must construct and gain the loyalty of a diverse team in order to defeat the enemy in a suicide mission. With the use of a completed saved game of its predecessor, the player can impact the story of the game in numerous ways. For the game, BioWare changed several gameplay elements and put further emphasis on third-person shooter aspects, including limited ammunition and regenerable health. In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original Mass Effect, the developers opted to create a plot where optional missions had as much intensity as the main mission. Mass Effect composer Jack Wall returned to compose Mass Effect 2's music, aiming for a darker and more mature sound to match the mood of the game. Mass Effect 2 also supports a variety of downloadable content packs, ranging from single in-game character outfits to entirely new plot-related missions. Notable packs include \""Kasumi - Stolen Memory\"", \""Overlord\"", \""Lair of the Shadow Broker\"", and \""Arrival\"". Mass Effect 2 was a commercial success and received considerable acclaim from video game publications, with the Xbox 360 version holding a score of 96 out of 100 at the review aggregate website Metacritic. Critics praised multiple aspects of the game, including its interactive storytelling, characterization, and combat.

"Mega Man Zero, known in Japan as Rockman Zero (ロックマン ゼロ), is a video game developed by Inti Creates and published by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console. It is the first installment in the Mega Man Zero series, the fifth series in Capcom's Mega Man video game franchise. It was released in Japan on April 26, 2002, and in North America and Europe later that year. Mega Man Zero is set 100 years following the Mega Man X saga of games. The plot follows the android protagonist Zero, who is awakened from a century of sleep to aid a human scientist named Ciel and her resistance force in a fight against the utopia of Neo Arcadia, which is attempting to unjustly wipe out all androids it views as threats. Like its predecessors in the original Mega Man series and Mega Man X series, Mega Man Zero is an action-platformer. However, the game forgoes the franchise's traditional format of letting the player select stages and acquire each boss's weapon. It instead features a smaller number of upgradable weapons and mission-based progression within a large, interconnected world. The player may also acquire special power-ups called \""Cyber Elves\"" which supplement the player's abilities or add various effects to a mission's stage. Mega Man Zero was produced as a commission product by Inti Creates for Capcom. The developer was responsible for all aspects of the game except the inclusion of the protagonist Zero, which was requested by series producer Keiji Inafune. Mega Man Zero has enjoyed a mostly positive press reception. Critics lauded the game's storyline, graphics, and tweaks on the franchise's classic action formula, though many were put off by aspects of its extreme difficulty level. Mega Man Zero garnered strong sales upon its debut and went on to produce three direct sequels on the GBA, as well as two titles in a sequel series on the Nintendo DS. It was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on October 22, 2014.",technology,9

"The Beatles: Rock Band is a 2009 music video game developed by Harmonix, published by MTV Games, and distributed by Electronic Arts. It is the third major console release in the Rock Band music video game series, in which players can simulate the playing of rock music by using controllers shaped like musical instruments. The Beatles: Rock Band is the first band-centric game in the series, and it is centered on the popular English rock group the Beatles. The game features virtual portrayals of the four band members performing the songs throughout the band's history, including depictions of some of their famous live performances, as well as a number of \""dreamscape\"" sequences for songs from the Abbey Road Studios recording sessions during the group's studio years. The game's soundtrack consists of 45 Beatles songs; additional songs and albums by the Beatles were made available for the game as downloadable content. The game was released internationally on 9 September 2009, coinciding with the release of new, remastered compact disc versions of the Beatles' albums. It incorporates many of the gameplay features of the Rock Band series; however, it is not an expansion pack for the Rock Band series and content for it and other Rock Band titles is not cross-compatible. Harmonix co-founder Alex Rigopulos described the game as \""a new, full game title production built from the ground up\"". Gameplay mechanics differ slightly from previous Rock Band games, including the addition of a three-part vocal harmony system. Subsequent games in the Rock Band series would reuse these new elements, including vocal harmonies. The game was developed with the blessing and critical input of Apple Corps, including former Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, who both made public appearances supporting the game. George Harrison's son Dhani helped to bridge discussion between Harmonix and Apple Corps, while Giles Martin, son of the Beatles' music producer George Martin, ensured high-fidelity versions of the Beatles' songs would be available. The Beatles: Rock Band was well received by the press, both as a genuine means of experiencing the music and history of the Beatles and as a standalone music video game. Although the game's sales were considered respectable, with more than half a million units sold during its first month of release in the United States, analysts had projected larger sales volumes and attributed the lower sales to waning interest in the rhythm game genre and the video game industry recovery from the late-2000s recession.",technology,9

It was developed by UK-based company Zippo Games for Rare; it was published by Acclaim and released in North America in March 1992 and in Europe on January 21, 1993. It is the third and final installment in the Wizards & Warriors series and is the sequel to the 1989 title Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II. The game picks up immediately from the events at the end of Ironsword where the knight warrior Kuros had just defeated the evil wizard Malkil from the peak of IceFire Mountain. Unaware that Malkil's spirit is still intact, Kuros gets struck by a bolt of magic from the spirit, causing him to lose his armor, memory, and honor. Malkil then flees to the city of Piedup and seizes the throne from Good King James. Meanwhile, Kuros, after wandering for months in the wilderness without weapons, armor, or food, arrives at the city of Piedup, where he must build strength and utilize various disguises and abilities in order to take on Malkil. The game is nonlinear and requires players to explore various areas to pick up items and gain abilities to unlock different parts of the city in order to progress. Wizards & Warriors III was developed by Zippo Games' founders Ste and John Pickford, who also had a few additional programmers and artists to assist them. The Pickford brothers designed the game as a homage to Ultimate Play the Game's (Rare's former incarnation) 1983 ZX Spectrum title Atic Atac; they also drew inspiration for gameplay and art from other NES titles such as Metroid, Faxanadu, and Super Mario Bros. 3. The game had moderate sales, though not as good as its predecessor Ironsword. It was praised for its bold graphics, expansive gameplay, and challenge. However, it was mostly criticized for its controls, lack of fighting, and the lack of continues or passwords. While the game received mixed reviews, Ste Pickford said that this game was his personal favorite. Zippo Games, which was acquired by Rare and was known as Rare Manchester during development, shut down shortly before this game's completion, and while the game hinted at another sequel, it has never occurred.",technology,9

"Gotcha! The Sport! is a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System that was released in 1987 based on the 1985 film Gotcha!. It uses the Nintendo Light Gun and is a capture the flag-style game played with paintball guns loaded with simulated paintballs. The player's mission is to get through the level, capture the enemy flag by shooting it, and return it to your base. This is while simultaneously trying not to get shot by the other team, run out of ammo, or run out of time. A light gun is necessary for this game, but one needs to also use the controller. The directional pad will move the screen left and right. Ammo boxes can be found sitting on the ground or carried by enemies in the background. It seems that only misses cost you ammo, so if one's aim is precise, they will receive a significant bonus for leftover ammunition. There are three levels in the game: Woods, Warehouse District and Snow Fields. The Woods and Snow Fields levels feature enemies in military garb, while the Warehouse District features enemies modeled after early 1980s punks. These rounds repeat in this order infinitely; each time around, the reaction time needed for the enemies to aim and fire is reduced.",technology,9
"Neverwinter Nights is a third-person role-playing video game developed by BioWare. Interplay Entertainment was originally set to publish the game, but financial difficulties led to it being taken over by Atari. It was released on Microsoft Windows on June 18, 2002.

Neverwinter Nights is set in the fantasy world of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, with the game mechanics based on the Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition rules. The game engine was designed around an Internet-based model for running a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG), which would allow end users to host game servers. The intent was to create a potentially infinite massively multiplayer game framework. This game was named after the original Neverwinter Nights online game, the first ever graphical massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), which operated from 1991 to 1997 on AOL. The original release of Neverwinter Nights includes the game engine, a game campaign that can be played as single player or in multiplayer mode, and on Windows releases, the Aurora toolset used for creating custom content that would run in the same engine. Three expansion packs were subsequently released for the game: Shadows of Undrentide in June 2003; Hordes of the Underdark in December 2003; and Kingmaker in November 2004.

The Toronto studio focused on the game's Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, and its later-announced Wii U version was developed by Ubisoft Shanghai. Blacklist's pre-release reception was generally positive, despite criticism of its new voice actor. The game received generally positive reviews when it was released, with praise for its level design, story, and multiplayer mode. However, criticism was directed at its dated graphics. It failed to meet Ubisoft's sales expectations, with sales of two million copies three months after its release.",technology,9
"Scribblenauts is an emergent puzzle action video game developed by 5th Cell and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the Nintendo DS. The game was released on September 15, 2009 in North America, September 30, 2009 in Australia, October 9, 2009 in Europe and on January 27, 2011 in Japan as Flash Puzzle: Maxwell's Mysterious Notebook (ヒラメキパズル マックスウェルの不思議なノート Hirameki Pazuru: Makkusuweru no Fushigi na Nōto) by Konami. It is the third Nintendo DS video game made by 5th Cell, the first two being Drawn to Life and Lock's Quest. The objective of Scribblenauts, as implied by its catchphrase \""Write Anything, Solve Everything\"", is to complete puzzles to collect \""Starites\"", helped by the player's ability to summon any object (from a database of tens of thousands) by writing its name on the touchscreen. The game is considered by its developers to help promote emergent gameplay by challenging the player to solve its puzzles within certain limitations or through multiple solutions. Jeremiah Slaczka, creator and director of Scribblenauts, envisioned the game as a combination of solving life situation puzzles alongside Mad Libs. His vision was brought to realization through the \""Objectnaut\"" engine created by 5th Cell's technical director, Marius Fahlbusch. Objectnaut allowed for a data driven approach, and a significant portion of the development time was spent researching nouns and their properties, and categorizing them into the Objectnaut database. This, along with the simple art designs of 5th Cell's Edison Yan, allowed for the team to easily add new words to the database without expending much effort to program new behavior. Scribblenauts was first shown in a playable form at the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo, and became a sleeper hit, winning several \""Best of Show\"" awards, being the first portable console game to win such praise. Reviewers believed that 5th Cell delivered on their promise to allow nearly any possible object to be created for use in Scribblenauts, but also lamented that the choice of controls in the game hampered their full enjoyment of the title. The success of the title has led to a number of sequels including Super Scribblenauts, Scribblenauts Remix, and Scribblenauts Unlimited. The series has sold over 13 million copies.",technology,9

In Infamous, the player controls the protagonist Cole MacGrath, a bike messenger caught in the center of an explosion that devastates several city blocks of the fictional Empire City. The explosion sends the city into chaos while Cole finds himself with new electricity-based super powers. Though the game's story follows Cole using his new abilities to restore some semblance of order to Empire City, the player is given several opportunities to use these powers for good or evil purposes in the game's Karma system. These choices ultimately affect character growth, the reaction of the City's populace towards Cole, and finer elements of gameplay and the story. Sucker Punch developed Infamous as a change of pace from their earlier Sly Cooper series of stealth-based games, but using a similar comic book-inspired origin story to help the player become more connected with Cole. The game's pacing in the introduction of new super powers and ease of movement about the city by unconventional means were critical factors during development. The desolate urban atmosphere was inspired by comics such as DMZ and Batman: No Man's Land. Amon Tobin was among the artists that helped to compile its soundtrack, which aimed to reflect the environment. The game was well received by the gaming press. It was praised for many of its elements, including the implementation of Cole's powers and climbing ability, and the game's content and mission structure. Reviewers commented on the repetitive nature of combat and enemies, limitations of the Karma system, and technical aspects in the graphical display.

"ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron is a platform video game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions and published by Sega in 1993 for the Sega Genesis. The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet. The player must hunt down these Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth. The game's platform format was a departure from the original ToeJam & Earl, a treasure hunt game with randomly generated levels, inspired by the game Rogue. Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original, but changed to a more generic type of game due to a lack of support for their vision on the part of Sega. The game was critically well received, with reviewers praising the graphics, soundtrack, fluid action and two-player mode. It was also a commercial success, but fans of ToeJam & Earl were disappointed and confused by the radical change in direction. Since its release ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron has been criticized for being too sharp a departure from the first game, and some later reviewers felt that the developers had been more interested in the publisher's wishes than the fans. Johnson and Voorsanger have stated they regret moving away from their prototype sequel in the vein of ToeJam & Earl. Research has suggested that a significant minority of fans favor ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron as the best in the series. Together with its predecessor, the game comprises one of the Mega Drive's \""key exclusive franchises\"", which eventually spawned a third installment in 2002, albeit a commercial failure with mixed reviews. ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron was re-released in 2007 for the Wii's Virtual Console, receiving mixed reviews. The game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade alongside its prequel in November 2012. In August 2014, ToeJam Earl 2 was listed on GamesRadar at #10 on \""Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time\"".",technology,9

"Conflict is a hex-based NES war game where the player is a commander who must lead his forces to victory. The player can earn fame points by occupying cities and airports and destroying units of the opponent's army; fame points are lost by losing units of one's army in battle or retreating from battles. The goal of each of the 16 scenarios is to destroy the enemy's flag tank. The first player controls the blue (Western Bloc) forces while the computer (or second player) controls red (Eastern Bloc) troops. Each player starts with two or three factories, at least one of which specializes in air combat units and at least one of which specializes in ground warfare units. On each turn, the player can, if he still has a factory that has not been destroyed, produce one military unit. The more fame points the player has, the more powerful units he can produce (e.g. tanks instead of infantry). The computer always starts with more fame points than the human; since this state of affairs tends to produce an increasingly overwhelming materiel advantage if left unaddressed, the goal of depleting the computer's fame points, usually by destroying powerful red Army units, tends to be a high priority at the beginning of the game. The hexagons can be plains, woods, mountains, barren terrain, shoals, seas, bridges, airports, towns, or factories. The terrain in each hexagon has an effect on maneuverability and the extent to which forces can take evasive action. Units can be repaired, refueled, and rearmed at cities or airports, depending on whether the unit is a ground or air unit. A sequel was released for the Super NES entitled Super Conflict.",technology,9

"Transformers: Fall of Cybertron is a third-person shooter video game developed by High Moon Studios and published by Activision. It is the sequel to the 2010 video game Transformers: War for Cybertron, and directly follows the events of that game as the Autobots struggle to defeat their Decepticon foes in a war for their home planet of Cybertron. The game was released on August 21, 2012, in North America and on August 24, 2012, in Europe for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, and August 2016 in PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Mercenary Technology developed the game's Windows version, while FunLabs developed the PS4 and Xbox One versions. The game tells the story of the Transformers, fictional robotic life forms, and the final days of conflict on their home planet of Cybertron. An origins subplot for the Dinobots is also told, reimagined from the Transformers: Generation 1 continuity. Other subplots also tell an adapted story for several characters. Some of the voice cast from the 1984 series The Transformers return to reprise their roles, including Peter Cullen as Autobot leader Optimus Prime and Gregg Berger as Grimlock. Other actors return to reprise their roles from Transformers: War for Cybertron. Fall of Cybertron received generally favorable reviews from critics. Critics generally felt that the game was true to the Transformers franchise and provided good fan service, but some thought that the story pace slowed at times. Gameplay was mostly praised, but some reviewers cited the removal of War for Cybertron's cooperative campaign as a low point. Graphics and audio also received broadly positive comments, though some reviewers noticed frame rate issues with the PlayStation 3 version. A tie in titled Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark, which is partially set between War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron was released June 24, 2014.",technology,9

"Thrasher Presents Skate and Destroy (also called Thrasher SK8 in Japan and Thrasher presents Skate and Destroy; see box art) is a skateboarding video game developed by Z-Axis and released in 1999 for the Sony PlayStation. A Game Boy Color version was also developed, but was later cancelled. This is likely due to when Thrasher was released, following in the wake of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and therefore being largely overshadowed (much like many other skateboarding and extreme sports games released after). Despite having less recognition, it received high scores from both IGN and GameSpot, being seen as \""technically superior to Tony Hawk\"" and an \""almost sim-like approach to the sport\"". Aside from less advanced graphics, this was one of the reasons Thrasher was ignored, as the learning curve (due to unconventional controls) is fairly steep compared to the 'pick up and play' style of the Tony Hawk games. The objective of the game is to take one of the six fictional skaters and work through a total of 12 levels across the globe, gaining sponsors, decks and clothing, and eventually appearing on the front of the Thrasher magazine - from which the game takes its name.",technology,9

"Gotcha is an arcade game developed by Atari and released in October 1973. It was the fourth game by the company, after the 1972 Pong, which marked the beginning of the commercial video game industry, and the 1973 Space Race and Pong Doubles. In the game, two players move through a maze, which continually changes over time. One player, the Pursuer, attempts to catch the other, the Pursued; if they do, a point is scored and the players reset positions. The game emits an electronic beeping sound, which increases in pace as the Pursuer gets closer to the Pursued, and each game lasts a set amount of time. Gotcha was designed by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, and a prototype was constructed by Cyan Engineering, Atari's semi-independent research and development subsidiary. The game's development was begun in July 1973; it was intended to be a part of Atari's strategy of developing multiple types of games to separate themselves from their competitors, who they saw as focused primarily on creating Pong clones. The cabinet was designed by George Faraco, initially with the joysticks encased in pink domes meant to represent breasts. Although this design inspired the advertising flyer on which it appears behind a man chasing a woman in a nightdress, it was changed to use regular joysticks soon after release. The game was not commercially successful; later sources have termed it as \""arousing little more than controversy\"". In addition to the main black-and-white game, limited runs were produced of a tinted color version and a true multi-color version of the game; the latter is believed to be the first color arcade game. Gotcha inspired an enhanced version featuring cops and robbers titled Maze Craze for the Atari 2600 in 1977, which was more popular than the original.",technology,9

It was re-released for the PlayStation Network in 2010. The game's protagonist is a young man named Alundra, who learns that he has the power to enter people's dreams. He is shipwrecked on an island, near the village of Inoa, where locals have been suffering from recurring nightmares that sometimes cause death. With his dream walking ability, Alundra proceeds to try to help the locals. The narrative becomes gradually darker and more twisted as the game progresses, dealing with mature themes such as death, clinical depression, fate, religion, and the essence of human existence. The gameplay involves extensive exploration of the island and various dungeons, with an emphasis on challenging puzzle solving, real-time action combat, and platforming, as well as interaction with non-player characters in the village of Inoa. The main gameplay innovation is a dream walking mechanic, where Alundra can enter people's dreams, with each of the dream levels having its own unique twist based upon the dreamer’s personality and traits. Upon release, Alundra earned unanimous critical acclaim as well as some initial commercial success. It was praised for its well-written story and characterization, smooth game mechanics and platforming, challenging gameplay and puzzles, and expansive overworld exploration.

Three Wonders was ported in 1998 to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation. Capcom rereleased this collection of games in 2006 onto Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox and Capcom Classics Collection Remixed on the PSP. The main character of the Chariot and Midnight Wanderers games Lou, was used as an assist only character for Marvel vs. Capcom he also had the option character from Midnight Wanderers known as Firestorm with him. His sprite is like an enlarged version of his sprites from Midnight Wanderers, he shares the same position stance, his trademark jump in which he holds his hand on his hat, and also the same shooting animation. The sprites are recoloured in a more vibrant cartoon-esque style, as opposed to the washed out effect from the games, to match the style of the Marvel vs Capcom series. If two players get Lou, then the second player's pallette is Green, and is most likely based on Siva's color clothing from the Midnight Wanderers game. Player two's firestorm is colored orange. Lou's Companion Siva, has a character based on him as a tribute, featuring on Capcom's Cannon Spike game. The character is called Shiba Shintaro.",technology,9
"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, known in Japan as Gyakuten Saiban (逆転裁判, lit. \""Turnabout Trial\""), is a visual novel adventure video game developed by Capcom. It was originally released for the Game Boy Advance in 2001 in Japan, and has since been ported to multiple platforms. The Nintendo DS version, titled Gyakuten Saiban Yomigaeru Gyakuten in Japan, was released in 2005 in Japan and North America, and in 2006 in Europe, and includes an English language option. The game is the first entry in the Ace Attorney series, and has received several sequels and spin-offs. The story follows Phoenix Wright, a rookie defense attorney who attempts to get his clients declared \""not guilty\"". Among other characters are Phoenix's boss, Mia Fey; his assistant and Mia's sister, Maya; and prosecutor Miles Edgeworth. The player controls Phoenix through two types of sections: investigations and courtroom trials. During investigations, they gather information and evidence, and during trials, they cross-examine witnesses and answer questions from the judge, the prosecutor, and the witnesses. The story is split into five cases, the fifth being introduced in the Nintendo DS version to take advantage of gameplay elements using the handheld's touchscreen and not available in the original Game Boy Advance version. Development of the game was handled by a team of seven people over the course of ten months. It was directed and written by Shu Takumi, and was originally planned to be a Game Boy Color game about a private investigator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. While the original version of the game takes place in Japan, the localization is set in the United States; this became an issue when localizing later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. The game has been mostly positively received by critics, who have appreciated its premise, writing, characters and presentation. The game has been a commercial success both in Japan and internationally, with the North American release selling higher than expectations and being hard to find in stores shortly after release. Other media based on the game has been made: a manga series premiered in 2006; a film adaptation of the game, titled Ace Attorney, premiered in 2012; and an anime series adaptation started airing in 2016.",technology,9

The story focuses on two characters, an angel and a demon, who are cast down to the mortal world in the midst of a battle and are forced to share a body in order to survive. The game began development in 2012: the project began when Masaru Oyamada told series producer Koichi Ishii that he could create a legitimate entry in the Mana series for mobile platforms. His idea was for a game true to the series that would reach a wide audience. The game's multiplayer, inspired by that used in Secret of Mana, was developed using the Photon Server middleware.

The PC versions of Monaco were developed and published by Pocketwatch Games while the Xbox Live Arcade version was published by Majesco Entertainment. The gameplay in Monaco consists of up to four players who each control different characters while they partake in heists and robberies in many different locations. Players can control one of eight characters, each of whom have their own characteristics, such as the Hacker who can put viruses onto security systems, or the Cleaner who can put guards to sleep. The main difference between single-player and multiplayer modes is that in multiplayer, when a player dies they must be revived before the level can be completed. Development of Monaco began while Andy Schatz was working for TKO Software, before he founded his own independent company Pocketwatch Games. The game started as nothing more than a Pac-Man clone that he referred to as \""The Sims meets Diablo meets Hitman\"". After being turned down twice by Microsoft Game Studios, Monaco was released for the Xbox 360 by Majesco Entertainment. After discussions with Schatz, the soundtrack was composed by American composer Austin Wintory, who had worked on the soundtracks for games such as Flow and Journey. Andy Nguyen, whom Schatz met while he was looking for playtesters, quit his job at Citibank so that he could spend more time helping with the development of Monaco as a level designer and producer, as well as working in booths. The game was positively received by reviewers and won two awards at the 2010 GDC Independent Games Festival. Reviewers praised the cooperative gameplay highly but said that the single-player was less fun because there was less to do. Many comparisons were made between Monaco and other media; the most common being the 1960 heist film Oceans 11. Reviewers liked the art style and said that the gameplay suited the minimalistic design.",technology,9

"Cyberball (サイバーボール Saibābōru) is an Atari Games arcade game of 7-man American football, using robotic avatars of different speeds, sizes, and skill sets set in the year 2022. The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from \""cool\"" to \""warm\"", \""hot\"", and \""critical\"" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to \""cool\"" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme. The standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well. The standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer-controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time. Cyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. It has also been ported to other platforms, including the Commodore Amiga and Sega Genesis.",technology,9

Stardew Valley was heavily inspired by the Harvest Moon video game series, with additions by Stardew Valley's sole creator, Eric Barone, to address some of the shortcomings of these games while using the opportunity as an exercise to improve his own programming and game design skills. Barone developed the title on his own over four years and interacted frequently with players who were interested in the title to get feedback. Chucklefish Games approached Barone with the offer to publish the title mid-way through development, allowing Barone to focus more on completing the game. Stardew Valley received positive reception from critics upon release, and was one of the highest-selling titles on Steam in the first few months of its release, eventually selling over one million copies. Barone later identified plans to expand the game to include co-operative play and support for other platforms, among other features.",technology,9
"Phelios (フェリオス Feriosu) is a 1988 vertical scrolling shooter released for the arcades in Japan by Namco. It runs on Namco System 2 hardware. A home version for the Mega Drive/Genesis was released in 1990. The game features a plot loosely based on Greek mythology. The player takes control of the knight Apollo, the god of the sun, who sets off on the legendary winged horse Pegasus, to rescue his lover, Artemis, the goddess of the moon, from the Titan, Typhon (the one that Zeus dropped a mountain on). The game takes names and little else from Greek mythology in which Apollo, god of the sun, was actually Artemis's brother. The game shows players an Artemis that acts as an stereotypical princess (but in Greek mythology, she was the goddess of the hunt, and took pride in never being with any man). The arcade version of this game was never released in the United States, due to Artemis's \""bondage/torture\"" scenes, which were shown between each stage, and were similar to those from the new version of Namco's own Rolling Thunder; while no nudity is shown, the scenes were still somewhat \""strong\"" to be shown in an arcade game during the early 16-bit era. This game's score display also gives the illusion of allowing values which do not end in \""0\"", like Hopping Mappy, Bakutotsu Kijūtei, and Metal Hawk did before it - however, the smallest point value that the game can award to a player for killing an enemy is 10.",technology,9
"Dino Master is a game for the Nintendo DS system similar to a fusion of Pokémon and the arcade game Qix. The player takes the role of \""Dave the Digger\"", who excavates fossils from various sites while avoiding enemies. The fossils can then be revived into living dinosaurs and pitted against each other in Battle Mode. To battle, the player would choose a part of the dinosaur to defend, and a part of the opponent dinosaur to attack. Smaller dinosaurs are weaker but have less vulnerability points; larger ones are stronger but have more vulnerability points. Powerful dinosaur are more rare to come by, and the player can dispose of the common kinds. In the story mode, the player traces a line across the field and any fossil concealed within the line is revealed. Enemies that collide with the line will send out a yellow \""bullet\"" which will follow the line toward the player until it strikes or the player reaches an area of security. If the player collides with an enemy, the player loses a life. If an enemy is trapped within the line, removed \""that enemy is vaporized. Several errors are in the game, such as the misnaming of dinosaurs. One error is the mislabeling of Plesiosaurus as Plateosaurus. The game has received poor reviews for errors in the touch-screen functionality and a battle system relying far too heavily on luck.",technology,9

It features a day-and-night system, variable weather effects, non-player characters with daily schedules, and various minigames. The player controls the teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki as he arrives in Hong Kong in 1987 in pursuit of his father's killer. His journey takes him to Kowloon and the mountains of Guilin, where he meets a young woman who is part of his destiny.

"3D Maze Man: Amazing Adventures is a 1998 computer game. Conceptually, it is influenced by Namco's popular arcade classic Pac-Man in that the main character (Maze Man) is a yellow sphere with a triangular mouth whose goal is to collect all the pellets in the current level and avoid the enemy ghosts. Like in Pac-Man, there are pellets which allow Maze Man to, for a short period of time (\""Party Time\""), eat the enemy ghosts, who regenerate from a specified location. Aesthetically, however, the 3D format of the game allows for a number of other features which differentiate it from Pac-Man. It provides for the ability to jump (also seen in Pac-Mania), enabling 3D Maze Man to avoid the ghosts when not in \""Party Time\"". Also, the navigable platforms can span multiple altitudes, allowing for sloped or \""elevator\"" platforms. In addition, some levels include colored keys which unlock certain correspondingly colored bricks, green spaces which prevent Maze Man from jumping, and red spaces which kill Maze Man on impact. Four other variants of 3D Maze Man also exist, all having the same gameplay style and engine, but different maze layouts and scenery. Among these is 3D Maze Man: Adventures in Winter Wonderland, which is a X-mas-themed variant, featuring the same character from the original wearing a Santa hat. The second is 3D Ms. Maze: Tropical Adventures, which features a female Maze Man, in the same style of Ms. Pac-Man, in tropical environments. The third is 3D Frog Man, in which the player controls a frog. In 2000, Elorg and Pac-Man licensee Hasbro (via Atari) sued to prevent the production and distribution of this and many of eGames' other offerings, which included a Tetris-inspired game. Per the settlement, sales continued until the end of September 2000.",technology,9

"Hunchback is an arcade game developed by Century Electronics in 1983. The player controls Quasimodo from the Victor Hugo novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The game is set on a castle wall. The player must cross the screen from left to right avoiding obstacles in order to ring the bell at the far right. Obstacles include pits which must be swung over on a long rope, ramparts which must be jumped (some of which contain knights with spears) and flying fireballs and arrows (to be ducked or jumped). To impose a time limit on each screen a knight climbs the wall, costing the player a life should he reach the top. Eventually, after completing a number of screens, the player must rescue Esmeralda. If this final screen is completed, the game begins again at a faster speed. The hunchback character was originally to be Robin Hood, hence the green costume and the game stages with arrows. The artist who drew the Robin Hood character left the company before the decision to change the theme to Hunchback. By the time a new artist was taken on, the green costume had become accepted and no-one questioned it (someone commented that the Robin Hood character, as drawn, looked like a hunchback). Ports were made for most home computer systems of the time by Ocean Software in 1984. It was their first arcade port. The exceptions to this are the BBC Micro version (which had already been released by Superior Software) and a later port for the MSX (1985).

"Alien Soldier is a 1995 side-scrolling run and gun video game developed by Treasure for the Mega Drive. Retail copies were released in Japan and PAL territories while in North America it was only available exclusively via the Sega Channel cable service. The story follows a powerful being named Epsilon-Eagle, who after being nearly killed becomes determined to avenge his near death and save his planet. The character has a variety of weapons and moves that the player must master to complete the game. Many gameplay ideas are borrowed from Treasure's earlier Mega Drive release, Gunstar Heroes. However, Alien Soldier puts an emphasis on challenging boss fights with short and easy levels serving as downtime in-between. Development lasted two years and was led by Hideyuki Suganami, who originally wanted to make the entire game himself but ultimately received support. He had ambitious plans for Alien Soldier but in order to meet his deadline, the game was released at roughly half-completion. Alien Soldier was released towards the end of the Mega Drive's lifecycle and was explicitly targeted for \""hardcore\"" Mega Drive gamers.

"Dragon Quest (Japanese: ドラゴンクエスト Hepburn: Doragon Kuesuto), also released as Dragon Warrior, is the first role-playing video game (RPG) in the Dragon Quest media franchise. It was developed by Chunsoft for the Family Computer (or Famicom for short) and published by Enix in Japan in 1986 as Dragon Quest and by Nintendo in 1989 in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System (or NES) as Dragon Warrior. Dragon Quest has been ported and remade for several video game platforms, including the MSX, PC-9801, X68000, Super Famicom, Game Boy Color, and mobile phones. In play, players control a hero character who is charged with saving the Kingdom of Alefgard and rescuing its princess from the evil Dragonlord. Dragon Warrior's story became the second part in a trilogy. Several more anime and manga games, which revolved around this overarching plot were created. Dragon Quest was created by Yuji Horii, who took inspiration from previous role-playing games such as Wizardry, Ultima, and his own 1983 title The Portopia Serial Murder Case. Horii wanted to create an RPG which would appeal to a wide audience of people who were unfamiliar with the genre of video games in general. He tried to place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement, as well as simplify the interface and expose the mostly Western computer genre to the Japanese console market. Manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama produced the game's artwork and Koichi Sugiyama composed its music. The North American version featured numerous changes, including battery-backed RAM save games (rather than using a password save system), modified character sprites and pseudo-Elizabethan English style dialog. Dragon Quest was commercially successful in Japan, with more than 2 million copies sold. Its release as Dragon Warrior in North America, and other Western countries, was less favorably received. Later, Western critics noted the game's shortcomings but acknowledged its importance to the genre. Its original pseudo-Elizabethan English script has been praised in many of these reviews. Fan-made ROM hacks were released with substantial changes to the game. The game's sound effects have also been orchestrated, and its music has been performed at numerous concerts. As a whole, Dragon Warrior has been credited with establishing the basic template for the Japanese console RPGs that followed.",technology,9

"Gravity Rush is an action-adventure video game developed by SIE Japan Studio and Project Siren, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation Vita. Directed by Keiichiro Toyama, the core mechanics of the game is the player's ability to manipulate gravity, allowing unique movements and navigation. The graphics are cel-shaded, which in Toyama's opinion stand out from the western photorealistic trend. Development of Gravity Rush began in 2008 as a PlayStation 3 project called Gravité before being eventually transferred to PS Vita. AI and visuals were slightly simplified during the process. Director Toyama thought that Gravity Rush overall suited the Vita better, because of \""its handy and accessible nature\"" and \""the impression of a different world existing beyond the screen\"" the player gets by tilting the device. An enhanced version of the game, titled Gravity Rush Remastered, was released in Japan in late 2015 and in Europe and North America in early 2016 for the PlayStation 4.",technology,9

"Shin Megami Tensei (真・女神転生, literally \""True Goddess Reincarnation\"") is a post-apocalyptic role-playing video game developed and published by Atlus. Originally released for the Super Famicom in 1992 in Japan, it has been ported to multiple systems and eventually released in the West for iOS in 2014. It is the third game in the Megami Tensei series and the first in the central Shin Megami Tensei series. The gameplay uses first-person navigation of dungeons and turn-based battles against demons. The player can recruit demons as allies by talking to them rather than fighting them, and two to three demons can be fused to create new demons. The story follows a nameless protagonist who lives in near-future Tokyo. When a portal to the realm of demons is opened, United States officials order a nuclear attack on Tokyo. Transported with two other supporting characters thirty years into the future, the protagonist finds the Earth ruined by a demon invasion, which is now the stage for an escalating conflict between the Order of Messiah and the Ring of Gaea, conflicting cults who wish to bring about kingdoms for their respective patron deities (YHVH and Lucifer). The story is influenced by moral decisions the protagonist makes, aligning him either with the Order, the Ring of Gaea, or setting him up as an independent agent. From the start of the production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei as a chance to create a game with the company's brand on it. The staff saw it as a remake of the previous Megami Tensei game; because of this, they knew what was going to happen in the story, and the development went smoothly. The story went through multiple revisions, and many settings were inspired by the staff's personal lives. The character and demon designs were done by Kazuma Kaneko, who used mythical figures and multiple clothing styles in his designs. Reception and sales for the game have been highly positive, and its success helped launch Atlus as a developer and publisher, along with popularizing the Megami Tensei series.",technology,9

"Wolfenstein 3D is a first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by Apogee Software and FormGen. Originally released on May 5, 1992, for MS-DOS, the game was inspired by the Muse Software video games Castle Wolfenstein and Beyond Castle Wolfenstein. In the game, the player assumes the role of Allied spy William \""B.J.\"" Blazkowicz during World War II as he escapes from the Nazi German prison Castle Wolfenstein and carries out a series of crucial missions against the Nazis. The player traverses through each of the game's levels to find an elevator to the next level or kill a final boss, fighting Nazi soldiers, dogs, and other enemies with knives, pistols, and other guns. Wolfenstein 3D was the second major release by id Software, after the Commander Keen series of episodes. In mid-1991, programmer John Carmack experimented with making a fast 3D game engine by restricting the gameplay and viewpoint to a single plane, producing Hovertank 3D and Catacomb 3-D as prototypes. After a design session prompted the company to shift from the family-friendly Keen to a more violent theme, programmer John Romero suggested remaking the 1981 stealth shooter Castle Wolfenstein as a fast-paced action game. He and designer Tom Hall designed the game, built on Carmack's engine, to be fast, violent, and unlike other computer games on the market at the time. It features artwork by Adrian Carmack and sound effects and music by Bobby Prince. The game was released through Apogee in two sets of 3 episodes under the shareware model, in which the first episode is released for free to drive interest in the rest. An additional episode, Spear of Destiny, was released soon after as a stand-alone retail title through FormGen. Wolfenstein 3D was a critical and commercial success, garnering numerous awards and selling over 200,000 copies by the end of 1992. It is widely regarded as having helped popularize the first-person shooter genre and establishing the basic run-and-gun archetype for many subsequent games, as well as showcasing the viability at the time of the shareware publishing model. FormGen developed an additional two episodes for the game, while Apogee released a pack of over 800 fan-created levels. Id Software never returned to the series, but did license the game's engine to numerous other titles before releasing the source code for free in 1995, and multiple other games in the Wolfenstein series have been developed by other companies since 2001.",technology,9

The gameplay of 10,000 Bullets focuses on this ability, in which the player must slow down the action in order to avoid the waves of enemy assaults and other hazards. 10,000 Bullets was directed by Suikoden franchise creator Yoshitaka Murayama, who left Konami in 2002 and started his own development firm, Blue Moon Studio, shortly thereafter. Accompanied by Spriggan illustrator Ryōji Minagawa and composers Yasunori Mitsuda and Miki Higashino, Murayama began producing 10,000 Bullets about a half a year after founding the new company. Murayama had wanted to create an action-shooter even before the Suikoden series. 10,000 Bullets was met with poor sales in Japan and a mediocre response from import reviewers. Critics found the game to be unoriginal and noted camera problems, but enjoyed the action sequences.",technology,9

"Final Fantasy Agito (Japanese: ファイナルファンタジーアギト Hepburn: Fainaru Fantajī Agito) is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix for mobile devices. The game's story is set in the universe of Final Fantasy Type-0, and is an entry in the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries. A downloadable episodic game similar to Final Fantasy Dimensions, it featured a turn-based combat system encouraging both single-player exploration and multiplayer combat. There was a day-night cycle tied to the real-world time of day, and featured a social element whereby talking with and befriending certain characters advances the player's ranking in the game. The game, which acts as a companion to Type-0, was set in the world of Orience during a time of war between its four nations. The story is seen through the eyes of a player-created Cadet entering the Rubrum Magical Academy during a time of war, and chosen to become the Agito, a figure destined to save Orience from destruction. The original protagonists of Type-0 appear in different roles and act as secondary characters. The story was intended to be played repeatedly, tying into the nature of the game's world and the eventual culmination of a player becoming the Agito. The game was developed around director Hajime Tabata's original concept for Final Fantasy Type-0 as a mobile game which would give players easy access to a universe within the Fabula Nova Crystallis series and would be influenced by player choice. The title stems from Type-0's earlier title Final Fantasy Agito XIII. Many of Type-0's staff returned, with Takeharu Ishimoto composing new music for the title, and former level designer Masayasu Nishida and texture artist Sayoko Hoshino returning respectively as producer and art director. The game came online in May 2014, and remained active until its servers were shut down in November the following year. Upon release in Japan, the game had 500,000 registered users within a week, and one million by November of the same year, but apparently numbers dropped after later negative impressions. Japanese and Western journalists were positive at its release. In August 2015, it was announced that the game could not continue in its current form, and would be replaced by a new version. Planned versions for the PlayStation Vita and Windows devices were scrapped, along with an announced localization. Its successor, an online multiplayer game Final Fantasy Type-0 Online, is set for release in 2016.",technology,9

"Giants: Citizen Kabuto is a third-person shooter video game with real-time strategy elements. It was the first project for Planet Moon Studios, which consisted of former Shiny Entertainment employees who had worked on the game MDK. Giants went through four years of development before Interplay Entertainment published it on December 6, 2000, for Microsoft Windows. A Mac OS X port was published by MacPlay in 2001 and the game was also ported to the PlayStation 2 later that year. Players take control of a single character from one of three humanoid races to complete the story or to challenge other players in online multiplayer matches. They can select heavily armed Meccaryns equipped with jet packs, or amphibious spellcasting Sea Reapers.

The console version rectified some of the flaws found in the PC versions, at the cost of removing several features.

Answering quickly and correctly earns virtual money to track the players' scores, while incorrect answers are penalized.

Prey uses a heavily modified version of id Tech 4 to use portals and variable gravity to create the environments the player explores. The game's story is focused on Cherokee Domasi \""Tommy\"" Tawodi as he, his girlfriend, and grandfather are abducted aboard an alien spaceship known as The Sphere as it consumes material, both inanimate and living, from Earth in order to sustain itself.

The more the meter is shifted towards a team, the better its players will perform (ex. If momentum bar is all the way full with a +5 number below it (or above it), all players on the team will have their attributes boosted 5 points). NCAA Football 07 also includes spring drills, an update to Race for the Heisman mode called Campus Legend (which plays more like NFL Superstar mode in Madden), ESPN integration, and a spring game in Dynasty and Campus Legend modes.

"Europa Barbarorum (Latin: Europe of the Barbarians), or EB, is a modification of the PC game Rome: Total War (RTW) based on the desire to provide Rome: Total War players with a more historically accurate game experience. The basic gameplay mechanics of the original game remain the same. The player controls an empire with the goal of conquering as much territory as possible and eliminating rival factions, which are controlled by the computer, or AI. The main campaign is split between two gameplay modes: a turn-based strategy map for moving whole armies and managing the empire, and a real-time battle map for fighting battles on the ground between two or more armies. The two game modes are linked, with success or failure in one game mode influencing the chances of success or failure in the other. Although set in a similar historical period and geographical area to the unmodified game (covering a timespan of 272 BC to 14 AD, compared to the original game's 270 BC to 14 AD), Europa Barbarorum is a total conversion modification as it replaces all the aspects of the original Rome: Total War game that can be replaced, such as unit models, statistics and the musical score.

"World Golf Tour is an online multiplayer virtual golf game. WGT Golf is played virtually on actual golf courses from around the world, using a patented 3D photorealistic georeferencing technology. Players can play with their family or friends, join a foursome, or start their own game. Players can choose and compete in a variety of virtual golf courses with up to four players at a time, play individually or enter into a skills challenge or in tournaments for prizes. Co-founders of WGT Media Chad Nelson and YuChiang Cheng collaborated in 2006 to come up with a high-quality golf game simulation that could be played for free on the Internet, and compete with or surpass the visual quality of console video sports games. Part of the intended goal was to have a fully integrated social golfing network website. They recruited JF Prata and Phil Gorrow of Electronic Arts to build the physics game engine that interfaces the thousands of photographs of each golf course that are used to create the WGT Golf experience. WGT Media launched a demo of the site in 2007 and commenced an open beta test in October 2008. The first golf course WGT Media captured and developed for play was the Ocean Course at Kiawah Island Golf Resort, located in South Carolina. Because of its authenticity in photographing and using actual golf courses for game development, WGT Golf differs from standard console video sports games that are produced fully by computer graphics, rendered by animators. Using this particular process of game development, it can allow real golfers to play virtually on real golf courses at WGT Golf and then take that knowledge and experience out to the actual golf courses themselves to test their skills and ability. Members of the PGA have even practiced at WGT Golf before going to tournaments. WGT Media does not charge a fee to play the HD courses it has developed (although there is a green fee for licensed non-HD courses). WGT Media derives revenue from high-profile online tournament sponsors, advertisements, and in-game micro transactions for upgrading player golfing equipment and for different choices in costume avatar clothing. Tournament cash prizes can be won and then used to buy virtual goods, like new clubs and clothing to customize the in-game avatar.In January 2011, a foursome completed the 100 millionth virtual round of golf played on WGT Golf. In October 2013, World Golf Tour Media released the mobile version for tablets and smartphones.",technology,9

"Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy (stylized as Goodbye, Galaxy!) is a two-part episodic side-scrolling platform video game developed by id Software and published by Apogee Software in 1991 for MS-DOS. It consists of the fifth and sixth episodes of the Commander Keen series, though they are numbered as the fourth and fifth, as Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is outside of the main continuity. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he first journeys through the Shadowlands to rescue the Gnosticenes so they may ask the Oracle how the Shikadi plan to destroy the galaxy, and then through the Shikadi's Armageddon Machine to stop them. The two episodes feature Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and other hazards. After the success of Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, the developers of the game, including programmers John Carmack and John Romero, designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack, left their jobs at Softdisk to found id Software. After making a prototype game in Keen Dreams to develop new ideas such as gameplay changes, graphical enhancements like parallax scrolling, and artistic improvements, the team worked on making a sequel trilogy of episodes from June to December 1991.

Goodbye, Galaxy did not initially sell as well as the first trilogy, which was attributed by the publisher and designer to its lack of a third episode hurting it given the shareware model of publishing. The pair of episodes has since been referred to as \""Apogee's hottest sellers\"", however. Reviews of the series praised the challenge and humor in the graphics and gameplay, especially in Goodbye, Galaxy. Although another Keen game was planned, during development id Software began work on Wolfenstein 3D, and its success, along with the development of Doom, led id to not develop any further Keen games.",technology,9

One main obstacle is avoiding collision with other aircraft. After two collisions, the plane will falter and the player's pilot is parachuted out. The player hears the sound of a parachute opening and sees an animation sequence of the pilot drifting to the ground. This is followed by one of several amusing pictures depicting the pilot in various landing places, such as a pigpen, a parched desert, a tree, or a barnyard of chickens, for example.

"Puyo Pop, known as Minna de Puyo Puyo (みんなでぷよぷよ, \""Everybody Puyo Puyo\"") in Japan, is the first of the Puyo Puyo games made for the Game Boy Advance, and the first produced by Sonic Team after Compile went bankrupt and gave the rights to Sega. However, at the same time, it is the last to use the original Madou Monogatari cast. It was not counted in the \""official\"" sequence, nor were the later Anniversary games, as evidenced by the naming of Puyo Puyo 7. The Japanese title refers to the game's four player mode and became a staple in future games. The Western title is simply named Puyo Pop, because previously all other releases had been masked by various alterations (except for the Neo-Geo Pocket version of Puyo Puyo Tsu). Some fans(who?) have dubbed it Puyo Pop GBA, to avoid confusion when using its English title. Out of all the Puyo Puyo games, this one seems to be the most directly influenced by Puyo Puyo Tsu, though some of the elements in game are reminiscent of Puyo Puyo~n, such as Rule Henka.",technology,9

"Space Race is an arcade game developed by Atari and released on July 16, 1973. It was the second game by the company after Pong (1972), which marked the beginning of the commercial video game industry. In the game, two players each control a rocket ship, with the goal of being the first to move their ship from the bottom of the screen to the top. Along the way are asteroids, which the players must avoid, and behind the action is a starfield. The game also displays the players' scores. Each game lasts a set amount of time, represented by a line at the bottom of the screen that shortens over time. Development of Space Race began in Summer 1972 under the name Asteroid by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, based on ideas by him and co-founder Ted Dabney during the development of the 1971 Computer Space, the first commercial video game and first arcade video game. The project was suspended after a few days and was resumed in Spring 1973. The final design was done by Dabney, possibly with assistance by Bushnell and Pong designer Allan Alcorn. The game was planned to be quick to create and was intended to fulfill an earlier contract with Bally Midway. The engineering and prototyping was done by Alcorn; after it was completed and the design given to Midway to be released as Asteroid, Atari produced its own nearly identical version as Space Race. Fifty Space Race cabinets were produced using a fiberglass design by George Faraco before the rest of the production was switched to a cheaper standard cabinet. Space Race was not commercially successful; Bushnell has stated that it was much less popular than Pong. At least one clone game was produced, the 1973 Astro Race by Taito. Midway held that the release of Space Race violated Atari's contract with them for Asteroid, and the companies agreed for Atari to forfeit royalty payments for the game. Space Race was the first racing arcade video game and the first game with a goal of crossing the screen while avoiding obstacles. An enhanced remake of the game for the Atari 8-bit family of computers was published by ANALOG Software in 1981 as Race in Space.",technology,9

"Civilization III: Conquests is the second and final expansion for the award-winning and best-selling computer game Civilization III. It was published in 2003. This expansion added eight new civilizations to the game, and including the eight civilizations from Play the World this brings the total number of playable civilizations up to thirty-one (the maximum supported by the game). The new civilizations are the Byzantines, the Dutch, the Hittites, the Incans, the Mayans, the Portuguese and the Sumerians. In addition to these playable civilizations, graphics for the Austrians are present in the editor so one can replace an existing civilization. Two new special traits are added in this pack: seafaring and agricultural. Many of the new civilizations take advantage of these new traits (e.g. the Sumerians are Scientific and Agricultural), and some old civilizations are changed to more appropriate ones (e.g. the English have been changed from Expansionist and Commercial to Seafaring and Commercial). New governments have also been added to the game, Feudalism and Fascism, and new Wonders of the World such as the Statue of Zeus and the Mausoleum of Mausollos. Four new bonus resources have been included, two of which provide food bonuses to previously unprofitable terrain. Oases can now be found in deserts, tropical fruit in jungles, sugar on plains and hills, and tobacco on grasslands and hills. In addition, two new types of terrain have been added. These are marshes and volcanoes. Players cannot construct cities on marshes, and cannot improve volcanoes in any way. Like jungles and flood plains, cities that have at least 1 citizen working a marsh may succumb to disease. Volcanoes may periodically erupt, destroying all improvements and cities and killing any units in some or all adjacent squares. The centerpiece of this expansion pack, however, was the inclusion of scenarios, intended for multiplayer gaming. Unlike the main (\""epic\"") game, these scenarios took much less time to play, and focused on a specific period in history. Generally the reception of this expansion pack was much better than that of Play the World. One year after Conquests was launched, the latest Civilization III stand-alone version, Civilization III: Complete was also released. This version included Civilization III, Play the World and Conquests. This version also includes several patches. Two years later, in 2005 Civilization IV was released.",technology,9
