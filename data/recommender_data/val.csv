"Heterololigo is a monotypic genus of squids containing the single species Heterololigo bleekeri. It was formerly classified in the genus Loligo; some authors still include it there, but DNA evidence supports its separation into a genus of its own. This species is known by the common name spear squid. This squid is native to the western Pacific Ocean along the coast of Asia. It can be distinguished from other species in its family by its shorter tentacles. It spawns in spring and summer in the northern part of its range, and in winter farther south. It has a life span of about one year. This squid is caught for food off the coast of Japan. It lays its eggs on the underside of submerged objects. In order to increase catches, artificial substrates have been installed along the coast of Japan to provide more egg-laying sites. This species is important in biological research. Its mitochondrial genome has been sequenced. Its neurons are used in neurobiology research. A unique aspect of the reproduction of this species has been well studied. The female has two sperm-storage sites in its body. There are two types of males, the larger \""consort\"" males and the smaller \""sneaker\"" males. Consorts insert sperm into the oviduct of the female, and sneakers place sperm into specialized tissue near the female's mouth. The two male types produce different types of sperm, as well: the large consorts produce sperm with short flagella, while the sneaker males have sperm with longer flagella. The consort sperm fertilize eggs internally, while sneaker sperm fertilize the eggs as they emerge from the female's body and brush past the external sperm-deposition site near the mouth.",nature,160503-chops.png,1

"Centropyge colini, the Cocos-Keeling angelfish, or Colin's angelfish is a small marine angelfish measuring up to 9cm, it is predominantly yellow with the upper quarter of its body being bright blue in colour. It inhabits reefs up to a depth of 100m in the Indo-west Pacific ocean, including around the Cocos (Keeling) Islands for which it is named. It is a rare and elusive species which spends much of its time hiding amongst rocks and rubble on reef top-offs. The fish move in harems of between 3 and 7 individuals, with one male and several females. If the male disappears the dominant female will change sex. Little is known about their ecology, and their natural diet is unknown. The fish is very rarely exported as part of the aquarium trade.",nature,2202_red_leaf.png,1

"Loch Doon (Scottish Gaelic: Loch Dhùin, pronounced [ɫ̪ɔxˈɣuːɲ]) is a freshwater loch in Carrick, Scotland. The River Doon issues from its northern end, while the loch itself receives waters from Loch Enoch (in the Galloway Hills) via Eglin Lane. In the 13th century, it was a site of Balloch Castle, owned by the Earls of Carrick. During the Scottish Wars of Independence it was held by one Gille Brighde, Sir Gilbert de Carrick, a native Carrick nobleman who surrendered it to the English. It was soon recovered by the Scots. In the 15th century, it was frequently in the hands of the Kennedy Clan, although it was briefly in the hands of the Maclellans (backed by William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas) after a siege in 1446. The castle was destroyed in the 16th century by King James V as part of a general policy of reducing the power of the barons. The loch was dammed in the 1930s, raising the water some 27 feet, in order to provide seasonal storage for the Galloway hydro-electric power scheme. As a reservoir, Loch Doon has an effective capacity of over 82 million cubic metres. When rainfall is plentiful, water is diverted to the loch from the Water of Deugh via a tunnel system. When water is required for power generation, water is released at Drumjohn to feed Kendoon power reservoir, the first in a series of generating stations and reservoirs on the Water of Ken. During the construction of the scheme, the ruins of the castle were moved from an island in the Loch to the shore to avoid the rising water.",nature,160540-dog.png,1

"Anogramma ascensionis (Ascension Island parsley fern) is a species of fern in the Pteridaceae family that is endemic to Ascension Island, a volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is one of eight putative species in the Anogramma genus. It was thought to have become extinct due to habitat loss, until four plants were found on the island in 2010. Over 60 specimens were then successfully cultivated at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and on Ascension Island. It is now classified as Critically Endangered. The small fern has delicate yellow-green leaves which appear similar to small sprigs of parsley. It was first recorded in 1842 by an amateur botanist, Dr A.B. Curror, and then officially described and named by Joseph Dalton Hooker after a visit he made to the island in 1843. It is endemic to the steep slopes of Green Mountain on the island. Another specimen was recorded in 1889, with few or no reports of specimens again until 1958, when a British scientist collected one on the north slope of the mountain. Further searches were conducted in 1976, 1986 and 1995 but were unsuccessful, and in 2003 it was officially declared extinct. There are ten species of plants endemic to Ascension Island, with seven of them still known to survive. The island lost much of its native habitat due to invasive animals and plants, beginning with goats introduced in the 16th century by Portuguese explorers. Other non-native animals, including rabbits, sheep, donkeys, and rats—along with over 200 non-native plant species—have destroyed much of the original habitat and plants. The introduction of non-native plants and animals was greatly hastened beginning in 1847, when Joseph Dalton Hooker advised the Royal Navy to import plants to the island to change the dry cinder soil and arid climate. Kew Gardens, whose director at the time was Hooker's father, helped ship trees to Ascension Island beginning in 1850. Green Mountain in particular was transformed through their efforts. Competition from invasive and non-native maidenhair fern (Adiantum) is believed by scientists to be partly responsible for the demise of A. ascensionis. A. ascensionis was rediscovered during a routine plant survey being performed by a team from the Ascension Island Government's Conservation Department. Because it was found growing in dry rock, on a very steep ridge, the four plants had to be watered and kept alive long enough to produce spores. Two of the plants produced spores before they died. After harvesting, the spores were quickly airlifted to Kew Gardens, where they were placed in a sterile environment to produce sporelings. Sixty new ferns were raised at Kew, along with more on Ascension Island. Since then, a small number of plants were discovered growing near the original four.",nature,1728_aquatic.png,1

The introduction of non-native plants and animals was greatly hastened beginning in 1847, when Joseph Dalton Hooker advised the Royal Navy to import plants to the island to change the dry cinder soil and arid climate. Kew Gardens, whose director at the time was Hooker's father, helped ship trees to Ascension Island beginning in 1850. Green Mountain in particular was transformed through their efforts. Competition from invasive and non-native maidenhair fern (Adiantum) is believed by scientists to be partly responsible for the demise of A. ascensionis. A. ascensionis was rediscovered during a routine plant survey being performed by a team from the Ascension Island Government's Conservation Department. Because it was found growing in dry rock, on a very steep ridge, the four plants had to be watered and kept alive long enough to produce spores. Two of the plants produced spores before they died. After harvesting, the spores were quickly airlifted to Kew Gardens, where they were placed in a sterile environment to produce sporelings. Sixty new ferns were raised at Kew, along with more on Ascension Island. Since then, a small number of plants were discovered growing near the original four.",history,1649_mythology.png,0

"The 2010 Libyan Cup Final was the 20th final of the premier cup competition in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Libyan Cup. The match took place on June 10, 2010 at the 11 June Stadium in Tripoli. The match was contested by 2008 runners-up Madina and 2003 winners Nasr. Both sides entered the final looking to end respective droughts without major silverware; Madina had not won a major title since their 2001 League-Supercup double, and Nasr had not won a major trophy since winning this competition in 2002–03. After a fairly poor first half, the game sprung into life just past the hour when defender Abubakr al Abaidy gave the Benghazi outfit the lead, chesting Mehdi ben Dhifallah's knockdown and volleying past Osama al Snousi. They were in front for just under four minutes as Guinean midfielder Ismail Bangoura lashed Efosa Francis' pullback into the top corner and equalised for Madina. With time running out and the game in the balance, striker Ihaab Bouseffi did a one-two with Ndubuisi Eze and the 24-year-old cracked a low drive into the bottom corner in the 89th minute. The title was Nasr manager Jamaal Bounawaara's (their fourth manager of 2009–10) second Libyan Cup title as a manager, following two cup wins with Ahly Tripoli in his playing career, after defeating Ittihad on penalties in 2002 with Hilal.

"Nigel Mansell won the race from pole position, in the process setting new records for most wins (nine) and most points (108) in one season, with McLaren drivers Gerhard Berger and Ayrton Senna second and third. However, the race is best remembered for the accident between Berger and Mansell's Williams team-mate Riccardo Patrese. Intending to make a pit stop, Berger moved towards the right side of the track at the beginning of the start/finish straight, with Patrese following in his slipstream. Failing to realise Berger's intentions, Patrese swerved to avoid him, but his right front wheel hit Berger's left rear and the Williams was launched into the air, almost hitting a pedestrian bridge over the track. Patrese escaped the accident shaken but unhurt, and neither driver was punished by the stewards. The debris from the crash, however, caused numerous other incidents, with Michael Schumacher and Pierluigi Martini suffering punctures, and JJ Lehto suffering slight injury as the driveshaft of the Williams went through the undertray of his Dallara, hitting him on the leg. Before this race, the financially troubled Fondmetal team pulled out of the sport, the third team to do so this season after Brabham and Andrea Moda. That meant that there were only 26 cars on the entry list, and hence this Grand Prix was the first since 1987 in which all cars automatically qualified for the race, regardless of qualifying lap times.

"Republic of Ireland vs France was a two-legged football play-off held on 14 and 18 November 2009 between the national teams of the Republic of Ireland and France as part of the UEFA second round of qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The first match was held on 14 November in Croke Park, Dublin, Ireland, and ended in a 1–0 victory for France with Nicolas Anelka scoring. The second leg, played on 18 November in the Stade de France outside Paris, France, finished in a 1–1 tie (with Robbie Keane and William Gallas each scoring one goal), meaning that France progressed to the World Cup at Ireland's expense based on the aggregate score. After the second leg, the French captain Thierry Henry admitted to Irish defender Richard Dunne that he had illegally handled the ball in the build-up to Gallas's match-winning goal, which had been scored in extra time with 17 minutes remaining in the game. The incident led to calls from the Football Association of Ireland and Government of Ireland to the world governing body FIFA for the result to be set aside and for the game to be replayed, and later for Ireland to be allowed to enter the World Cup as an unprecedented supernumerary 33rd team. Henry, previously seen by many in the sport as a fair footballer, was characterised as cheating, with the incident being compared to Diego Maradona's \""Hand of God\"" goal, and TIME magazine comparing Henry's goal (sometimes called \""Le Hand of God\"") to a top ten list of sporting cheats. Henry considered retiring from international football due to the reactions to the game, while the Swedish match referee Martin Hansson considered quitting as a referee. The result sparked debate on the issue of fair play in football, and fuelled the ongoing debate on the introduction of video refereeing and Additional Assistant Referees into the sport.

"Lennon is a musical with music and lyrics by John Lennon and book by Don Scardino, who also directed its premiere. The musical is about the life of John Lennon and was notable for Scardino's choice to be almost exclusively based on Lennon's own words and to focus on Lennon's solo career, with no songs from the Lennon–McCartney catalogue. The \""$7 million bio-musical\"" first opened in San Francisco, California in April 2005. After what The Times described as \""a troubled try-out in San Francisco, a cancelled run in Boston and a radical rewrite\"", it had 42 previews and 49 performances on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre from 14 August to 24 September 2005. The role of Lennon is played by performers of both sexes and different ages and skin colours, an approach Scardino said was inspired by \""I Am the Walrus\"" where Lennon writes, \""I am he, as you are he, as you are me, and we are all together.\"" This use of multiple actors was scaled back after the San Francisco production, with the final rewrite having a single actor narrating Lennon's story. Yoko Ono was actively involved in the production, retaining final script approval and requiring the show's Broadway producers to complete the script and present it to her live (albeit in workshop format). The show's credits included the phrase \""With Special Thanks to Yoko Ono Lennon\""; Ono was frequently seen at the theatre during the show's Broadway run. The limited use of Beatles songs, attributed to creative choices and not licensing issues, led critics to dismiss the work as \""Ono-centric\"". Ono was unapologetic about the choice: \""If we put Yesterday in, it's not really fair to the Beatles because we're leaning on their power. We're talking about John now, thank you.\"" She later said \""It is definitely John's story – from Liverpool 1940 to New York 1980. I am the B-side, and that's how it should be.

"'S gibt nur a Kaiserstadt, 's gibt nur a Wien!  is a polka written by Johann Strauss II in 1864. The title of this polka was inspired from the waltz duet in the Singspiel (musical comedy) 'Aline' by Adolf Bäuerle with music by Wenzel Müller first performed at the Theater in der Leopoldstadt on 9 October 1822. The song titled 'Was macht denn der Prater' was a hit during its day whereas its refrain 'Ja nur ein' Kaiserstadt, ja nur a Wien' (Yes, only one Imperial City, yes only one Vienna!) became a popular household phrase. While Stauss adapts no music from the stage work, he did incorporate Haydn's Austrian Hymn 'Gott erhalte' into the Finale of the polka. Strauss first performed the work during a lucrative Russian tour at Pavlovsk where he frequently performed at the Vauxhall Pavilion. At his penultimate concert there on 8 October 1864 (Russian calendar 26 September), he performed the work under its original title 'Vergiß mein nicht' (Forget me Not).

With a minimum of hype or fanfare, working with a craftsman's discipline and an artist-mystic's creativity, Morrison has steadily amassed one of the great bodies of recorded work in the 20th century. Morrison made his first recording playing saxophone on \""Boozoo Hully Gully\"" with the International Monarchs in 1962. His first recording session as lead singer/songwriter with Them was produced by Dick Rowe at Decca's studio. \""Don't Start Crying Now\"" was the first single released and the garage rock classic, \""Gloria\"" was also recorded at this session. \""Baby, Please Don't Go\"" (recorded October 1964) was released November 1964 with \""Gloria\"" as the B-side and was a Top Ten hit in the UK. \""Here Comes the Night\"" was Them's second hit in 1965, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 24 in the US. Morrison had his first recording session as a solo artist for Bang Records in New York City for Bert Berns on 28 March 1967. One of the songs was \""Brown Eyed Girl\"" which charted at No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100.

"(For the 1995 film based on the musical, see The Fantasticks (film).)(Not to be confused with The Fantastics.)\nThe Fantasticks is a 1960 musical with music by Harvey Schmidt and lyrics by Tom Jones. It tells an allegorical story, loosely based on the play The Romancers (Les Romanesques) by Edmond Rostand, concerning two neighboring fathers who trick their children, Luisa and Matt, into falling in love by pretending to feud. The fathers hire traveling actors to stage a mock abduction, so that Matt can heroically seem to save Luisa, ending the supposed feud. When the children discover the deception, they reject the arranged love match and separate. Each then gains disillusioning experiences of the real world, seen in parallel fantasy sequences. They return to each other bruised but enlightened, and they renew their vows with more maturity. The show's original off-Broadway production ran a total of 42 years and 17,162 performances, making it the world's longest-running musical. The musical was produced by Lore Noto. It was awarded Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre in 1991. The poetic book and breezy, inventive score, including such familiar songs as \""Try to Remember,\"" helped make this show so durable. Many productions followed, as well as television and film versions. The Fantasticks has also become a staple of regional, community, and high school productions virtually since its premiere, with approximately 250 new productions each year.

"Love Life is a musical written by Kurt Weill (music) and Alan Jay Lerner (book and lyrics).

The original production starred Ray Middleton and Nanette Fabray, was directed by Elia Kazan, and choreographed by Michael Kidd. The show told the story of a married couple, Sam and Susan Cooper, who never age as they progress from 1791 to 1948, encountering difficulties in their marriage (and thus the very fabric of marriage) as they struggle to cope with changing social mores. One of the earliest examples of the concept musical, the action of Love Life was interspersed with vaudeville-style numbers that commented on the story, in a way very similar to Cabaret (which opened in 1966). No official cast recording of Love Life has ever been made; a strike at the time of the original production prevented preserving the original cast of this show, as also happened with Where's Charley? the same year.

"\""So geht das jede Nacht\"" (English translation: \""That's How It Is Every Night\"") was the second German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1956 (the rules of that Contest allowed two entries per country, the only time that this was the case), performed in German by Freddy Quinn. The song was performed eleventh on the night (following Belgium's Mony Marc with \""Le plus beau jour de ma vie\"" and preceding France's Dany Dauberson with \""Il est là\""). As the scoreboard for this Contest has never been made public, it is impossible to make any definite statements about the song's final place or score - other than the fact that it did not win. With music by Lothar Olias and lyrics by Peter Mösser, the song is an up-tempo number in the style of early rock and roll hits like \""Rock Around The Clock\"" by Bill Haley & His Comets. In the song, Quinn explains to the object of his affections that he is not happy with the number of other men she goes out with over the course of the week. She sees Jimmy on Sunday, Jack on Monday, Johnny on Tuesday, Billy on Wednesday, Tommy on Thursday, Ben on Friday and \""someone I don't even know\"" on Saturday. Quinn declares that \""I've loved you since you were a baby\"" and explains that he drives her to the office, sends her flowers and \""takes you mother...to the zoo\"" and thus feels that he deserves better treatment than this, but despite his abilities at dancing the boogie and cha-cha-cha, she ignores his entreaties.The song ends with Quinn's own confession that \""But if you were thinking I've been sitting at home/I've been going out with someone else every day\"". Honours are thus even. The song achieved moderate fame in Japan, where it was rerecorded in Japanese as \""Kimi Wa Maiban No\"". The song was accompanied at the 1956 contest by Walter Andreas Schwarz with \""Im Wartesaal zum großen Glück\"" and was succeeded as German representative at the 1957 Contest by Margot Hielscher with \""Telefon, Telefon\"".",music,2066_musician.png,1

Prior to the album's recording, Usher split with his mother, Jonnetta Patton, as manager and hired Benny Medina. Usher's estranged father died months before the release of Here I Stand; this also influenced themes of the album. It was originally to be titled \""Measure of a Man\"", but Usher named it Here I Stand to mark \""a new chapter in [his] life\"". Usher promoted Here I Stand by performing on several television shows including Total Request Live, 106 & Park and Good Morning America.

He tells his lover how he feels, likening her to \""a flower that I picked\"", implying that the relationship was of a comparatively short duration. He also comments on the nature of love itself, singing that it is \""winning and losing\"".

"Via Galactica is a rock musical with a book by Christopher Gore and Judith Ross, lyrics by Gore, and music by Galt MacDermot. It marked the Broadway debut of actor Mark Baker. Originally entitled Up!, it offers a futuristic story of social outcasts living on an asteroid in the year 2972. Among them is Gabriel Finn, a space sanitation man who collects trash in a clamshell-shaped garbage ship called the Helen of Troy. The storyline was so incomprehensible that at the last moment producers decided to insert a plot synopsis in the Playbill, but audiences were still baffled by what they were witnessing unfold on stage. Pyrotechnic displays and other special effects did little to enhance the project. After fifteen previews, the Broadway production, directed by Peter Hall, produced by George W. George and choreographed by George Faison, opened on November 28, 1972, the first production at the brand new Uris Theatre where, unable to withstand a universal assault by the critics, it ran for only seven performances. The cast included Raul Julia, Irene Cara, Keene Curtis, Chuck Cissel, Ralph Carter, Melanie Chartoff, and Virginia Vestoff. Via Galactica, one of the first Broadway shows to lose more than $1 million, was MacDermot's second flop of the season. His Dude had closed after 16 performances a mere five weeks earlier. For some reason, the composer presented much of the score at the Cooper Union on 4 April 2002.",music,2100_radio.png,1

"Donald Cousens Parkway or York Regional Road 48, also referred to historically as the Markham Bypass or Markham Bypass Extension, is a regionally maintained arterial bypass of Markham in the Canadian province of Ontario. Named for former Markham mayor Don Cousens in April 2007, the route initially travelled northward from Copper Creek Drive in Box Grove, south of Highway 407, to Major Mackenzie Drive (York Regional Road 25). A southern extension to Steeles Avenue was later completed and the name Donald Cousens Parkway applied along the extension to Ninth Line. In addition to its role of funneling through-traffic around downtown Markham, the route serves as a boundary to residential development as land to the north and east are part of the protected Rouge Park and southwest limits of the planned Pickering Airport. Construction of the route began in 2002 north of 16th Avenue. In 2004, an interchange with Highway 407 was constructed along with a connection north to Highway 7. Both segments and the interchange were opened by December of that year. The following year, construction began to connect these two segments as well as on the Box Grove Bypass along Ninth Line; the former opened in October 2006 and the latter in the spring of 2007. Construction of the most recently opened segment, connecting the Box Grove Bypass to the interchange with Highway 407, began in 2009. It opened after several delays in 2012 and included a realignment of 14th Avenue. Donald Cousens Parkway and a planned connection with Morningside Avenue form the East Metro Transportation Corridor, originally envisioned by the province in the 1970s as a six lane municipal expressway. During the mid-1990s, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) conducted studies and identified the need for the corridor by 2011. Although York had intended for a continuous alignment, the City of Toronto has opposed the direct connection between Morningside and Donald Cousens Parkway. As a result, it is now proposed to connect Morningside Avenue and Donald Cousens Parkway via a widened Steeles Avenue.

Named for former Markham mayor Don Cousens in April 2007, the route initially travelled northward from Copper Creek Drive in Box Grove, south of Highway 407, to Major Mackenzie Drive (York Regional Road 25). A southern extension to Steeles Avenue was later completed and the name Donald Cousens Parkway applied along the extension to Ninth Line. In addition to its role of funneling through-traffic around downtown Markham, the route serves as a boundary to residential development as land to the north and east are part of the protected Rouge Park and southwest limits of the planned Pickering Airport. Construction of the route began in 2002 north of 16th Avenue. In 2004, an interchange with Highway 407 was constructed along with a connection north to Highway 7. Both segments and the interchange were opened by December of that year. The following year, construction began to connect these two segments as well as on the Box Grove Bypass along Ninth Line; the former opened in October 2006 and the latter in the spring of 2007. Construction of the most recently opened segment, connecting the Box Grove Bypass to the interchange with Highway 407, began in 2009. It opened after several delays in 2012 and included a realignment of 14th Avenue. Donald Cousens Parkway and a planned connection with Morningside Avenue form the East Metro Transportation Corridor, originally envisioned by the province in the 1970s as a six lane municipal expressway. During the mid-1990s, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) conducted studies and identified the need for the corridor by 2011. Although York had intended for a continuous alignment, the City of Toronto has opposed the direct connection between Morningside and Donald Cousens Parkway. As a result, it is now proposed to connect Morningside Avenue and Donald Cousens Parkway via a widened Steeles Avenue. However, no timeline has been announced as of 2015.",music,161_sheet-music.png,0
"The Dolmabahçe–Bomonti Tunnel (Turkish: Dolmabahçe–Bomonti Tüneli) is a twin-tube road tunnel under the inner city of Istanbul, Turkey connecting the neighborhood of Dolmabahçe in Beşiktaş district and Bomonti in Şişli district. Opened in 2010, it is 2,360–2,390 m (7,740–7,840 ft) long and under 40 m (130 ft) underground. The tunnel is part of a project of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality to build seven tunnels for the \""City of Seven Hills\"", which is the nickname of Istanbul. It was opened on 14 June 2010 as the second tunnel of this project following the Kağıthane-Piyalepaşa Tunnel after a construction time of three years. Its southeast entry is situated north of the BJK İnönü Stadium in Dolmabahçe. It runs under the neighborhoods Taksim and Feriköy. The northwest entry is located in Bomonti. The two independent tubes with two lanes each are 2,360 metres (1.47 mi) and 2,390 m (1.49 mi) long. The tunnel is linked with the Kağıthane-Piyalepaşa Tunnel over a connection road of 500–600 m (1,600–2,000 ft) between Bomonti and Piyalepaşa. By using both tunnels, the driving time between Dolmabahçe and Kağıthane during rush hours drops from 45 minutes to 5 minutes at a driving speed of about 70 km/h (43 mph).",transportation,2787_car_speed.png,1

"New York State Route 286 (NY 286) is an east–west state highway in the vicinity of the city of Rochester, New York, in the United States. It links Rochester to its eastern suburbs and to western Wayne County. The western terminus of the route is at exit 7 on NY 590 just inside the Rochester city limits. Its eastern terminus is at NY 350 in Walworth. NY 286 is named Browncroft Boulevard from NY 590 to its junction with Qualtrough and Clark roads in Penfield. This portion of the highway passes through predominantly residential areas. East of this intersection, the route is known as Atlantic Avenue and traverses more rural areas. The entirety of NY 286 east of Blossom Road was originally designated as part of NY 35 during the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 35 exited Rochester on Blossom Road and followed it east to modern NY 286. The remainder of Browncroft Boulevard was designated as New York State Route 35B, an alternate route of NY 35, in the mid-1930s. The NY 35 and NY 35B designations were eliminated in the early 1940s and replaced with NY 383 and New York State Route 383B, respectively. NY 383 was truncated to downtown Rochester in 1949, at which time its former routing from Rochester to Walworth became NY 286. NY 383B was renumbered accordingly to New York State Route 286A. In the 1960s, the portion of Browncroft Boulevard from the Sea Breeze Expressway to Blossom Road was upgraded into a divided highway. NY 286 was rerouted to follow the improved Browncroft Boulevard while NY 286A was shifted south onto NY 286's former alignment along Blossom Road.

"The Walt Whitman Bridge is a green-colored single-level suspension bridge spanning the Delaware River from Philadelphia to Gloucester City, in Camden County, New Jersey, United States. Named after the poet Walt Whitman, who resided in nearby Camden toward the end of his life, the Walt Whitman Bridge is one of the larger bridges on the east coast of the United States. The bridge is owned and operated by the Delaware River Port Authority.Construction on the bridge began in 1953, and it opened to traffic on May 16, 1957. The bridge has a total length of 11,981 feet (3,652 m), and a main span of 610 metres (2,000 ft). The bridge has seven lanes, three in each direction and a center lane that is shifted variably (via a zipper barrier) to accommodate heavy traffic.

"The Tsentralno–Zavodska Line (Ukrainian: Центрально-Заводська лінія) is the first and only line of the Dnipropetrovsk Metro in Dnipropetrovsk, located in eastern Ukraine.

"Taiwan High Speed Rail (abbreviated THSR or HSR) is a high-speed rail line that runs approximately 345 km (214 mi) (actual length in operation is 348.5 km (217 mi)) along the west coast of Taiwan, from the national capital Taipei to the southern city of Kaohsiung. With construction managed by a private company, Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation (THSRC), which also operates the line, the total cost of the project was US$18 billion. At the time it was built, this was one of the world's largest privately funded rail construction schemes. The system is based primarily on Japan's Shinkansen technology. The line opened for service on 5 January 2007, with trains running at a top speed of 300 km/h (186 mph) from Nangang to Zuoying in as little as 105 minutes, reaching almost 90% of Taiwan's population. Most intermediate stations on the line lie outside the cities served; however, a variety of transfer options, such as free shuttle buses, conventional rail, and metros have been constructed to facilitate transport connections. Ridership initially fell short of forecasts, but grew from fewer than 40,000 passengers per day in the first few months of operation to over 129,000 passengers per day in June 2013. The system carried its first 100 million passengers by August 2010 and over 200 million passengers had taken this system by December 2012. In the initial years of operation, THSRC accumulated debt due to high depreciation charges and interest, largely due to the financial structure set up for the private company. In 2009, THSRC negotiated with the government to change the method of depreciation from depending on concessions on rights to ridership. At the same time, the government also started to help refinance THSRC's loans to assist the company so it could remain operational and profitable.",transportation,160877-yacht.png,1

"The George Massey Tunnel (often referred to as the Massey Tunnel) is a highway traffic tunnel in the Metro Vancouver region of southwestern British Columbia. It is located approximately 20 km (12.4 mi) south of the city centre of Vancouver, British Columbia, and approximately 30 km (18.6 mi) north of the Canada–United States border at Blaine, Washington. Construction, costing approximately $25 million, began on the tunnel in March 1957, and it was opened to traffic on May 23, 1959 as the Deas Island Tunnel. Queen Elizabeth II attended the official opening ceremony of the tunnel on July 15, 1959. It carries a four-lane divided highway under the south arm of the Fraser River estuary, joining the City of Richmond to the north with the Corporation of Delta (a municipality) to the south. It is the only road tunnel below sea level in Canada, making its roadway the lowest road surface in Canada. The tunnel forms part of Highway 99.

"The Wabasha–Nelson Bridge bridges is a truss bridge that connects Wabasha, Minnesota with Nelson, Wisconsin. It is an automobile bridge that traverses the Mississippi River. The bridge has a street setup, with one lane in either direction. It carries Minnesota State Highway 60 and WI 25 in either direction. The current bridge replaced a bridge built in 1931 that was only 19 feet wide and had two right angles on the Minnesota side. The bridge was constructed in a unique way: the 470-foot truss span was built on falsework on two barges out of the current and the main river channel. When the truss section was completed, engineers floated the span on its barges down the river. The bridge was positioned higher than the supports so it could be brought into place. Once the span was in place, they flooded the barges to bring the bridge into position vertically. This operation took only eight hours to complete.",transportation,5842_highway-powerpoint-template.png,1

The GNR arrived after other railways had been established in the West Yorkshire area and many of their lines were heavily reliant on tunnels and grand viaducts, the Shipley and Windhill line being an exception to this, although it did have some steep gradients. The branch extended for 8.5 miles (13.7 km) between the two termini of Shipley Windhill and Bradford Exchange. The route as built from Laisterdyke to Shipley was actually only 6.5 miles (10.5 km) as the initial section from Bradford Exchange to Laisterdyke was already in existence as part of the Great Northern Railway's line to Leeds. The Midland Railway Company offered a shorter route between Shipley and Bradford (Forster Square) due southwards via Bradforddale on the valley floor at a distance of only 2.5 miles (4 km). The Shipley and Windhill Line was amalgamated into the London North Eastern Railway in 1923 and became part of the North Eastern Region of British Rail in 1948.",education,161013-microscope.png,0

"Broadway Avenue Bridge is a girder bridge that spans the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It was built in 1987 and was designed by Norman C. Davis and Shawn Pierson Bruns of VanDoren-Hazard-Stallings. The bridge has a rather streamlined shape, but its piers are more ornate. The piers have two flat columns that taper together, with a base that extends out to the full width of the bridge. This bridge is the third bridge to cross the river at this location. The first bridge was a wooden structure completed in 1857, but washed away in a flood in 1859. The second bridge was a four-span Pratt truss bridge built in 1887. It spanned the northern industrial district that was developing on both sides of the river. The 1887 bridge was very ornate, featuring finials on each top corner and a band of scrolls, crosses, and lines between them. The horizontal struts and guard railings used X-shapes as a pattern. In 1950, the bridge was raised 20 feet to allow barges and larger boats to pass underneath. The old bridge was removed in 1985, but a single span of the bridge lives on as the Merriam Street Bridge that connects Nicollet Island to the St. Anthony section of Minneapolis.",transportation,160259-cargo.png,1

"Stayton–Jordan Bridge is a covered bridge in Stayton in Marion County in the U.S. state of Oregon. Built in 1998, it carries foot traffic over the Salem Power Canal in Pioneer Park. The canal is a diversion from the North Santiam River. A predecessor of the 1998 structure was a covered bridge spanning Thomas Creek near Lyons in Linn County. Built in 1937, it was one of seven similar Linn County covered bridges with large side openings. Known as the Jordan Bridge, it took its name from the rural community of Jordan, which was nearby. In 1986, after Linn County officials decided to replace the bridge, a group of Stayton residents acquired the dismantled structure and, with the help of volunteers and Marine Corps reservists, rebuilt it in Stayton. The rebuilt bridge, spanning the power canal, opened to pedestrian traffic in 1988. However, in December 1994, Christmas lights set fire to the bridge roof, and the rest of the structure was either destroyed or too badly damaged to be salvaged. Local residents subsequently built a new, nearly identical bridge at the site, and it is the one that opened in 1998. In addition to functioning as a public footbridge, the structure is sometimes reserved for private events such as weddings.",transportation,5842_highway-powerpoint-template.png,1

"The Michigan Avenue Bridge (officially DuSable Bridge) is a bascule bridge that carries Michigan Avenue across the main stem of the Chicago River in downtown Chicago, Illinois, United States.

Construction of the bridge started in 1918, it opened to traffic in 1920, and decorative work was completed in 1928. The bridge provides passage for vehicles and pedestrians on two levels; it is an example of a fixed trunnion bascule bridge, which is also known as a \""Chicago style bascule bridge\"". The bridge is included in the Michigan–Wacker Historic District and has been designated as a Chicago Landmark. The location is significant in the early history of Chicago.

"Jugantar Patrika (Bengali: যুগান্তর) was a Bengali revolutionary newspaper founded in 1906 in Calcutta by Barindra Kumar Ghosh, Abhinash Bhattacharya and Bhupendranath Dutt. A political weekly, it was founded in March 1906 and served as the propaganda organ for the nascent revolutionary organisation Anushilan Samiti that was taking shape in Bengal at the time. The journal derived its name Jugantar (Lit:New Era) from a political novel of the same name by renowned Bengali author Shivnath Shastri. The journal went on to lend its name to the Western Bengal wing of the Anushilan Samiti, which came to be known as the Jugantar group. The journal expounded and justified revolutionary violence against the British Raj as a political tool for independence, and denounced the right and legitimacy of the British rule in India. It was also critical of the Indian National Congress and its moderate methods which was viewed as aiding the Raj. Its target audience was the young, literate and politically motivated youth of Bengal, and was priced at one paisa. The paper rapidly acquired a broad popularity, at one time having a readership of 20,000. Bhupendranath Dutt served as the editor of the newspaper till his arrest in 1907, although it also published articles from a number of noted Bengali revolutionaries including Barindra Kumar Ghosh and Aurobindo Ghosh. It faced prosecution a number of times by the British Indian government for publishing seditious articles. Bhupendranath Dutt was arrested in 1907 for publication of articles \""inciting violence against the Government of India\"", for which he was sentenced to a year's rigorous imprisonment. The paper was ultimately forced to shut down in 1908, amidst financial ruins following the prosecutions, and after the passage of The Newspapers (Incitement to offences) act in June 1908 which made its position vulnerable.",history,2996_history.png,1

"The Cricketer is a monthly English cricket magazine providing writing and photography from international, county and club cricket. The magazine was founded in 1921 by Sir Pelham Warner, an ex-England captain turned cricket writer. Warner edited the magazine until 1963. Later editors included E. W. Swanton and Christopher Martin-Jenkins. Apart from its coverage of the contemporary game, The Cricketer has also contributed to the sport's history. For example, its researchers uncovered a letter in The Weekly Journal dated 21 July 1722, which is our source for an early fixture in Islington between London and Dartford on 18 July 1722. The magazine is responsible for the National Village Cup, an annual competition between village cricket sides, with the final played at Lord's. After surviving for over 80 years as an independent publication, Wisden purchased the magazine and in 2003 merged it with Wisden Cricket Monthly. A new magazine called The Wisden Cricketer enjoyed some success under the editorship of John Stern over the next eight years. In December 2010, a private equity company called Test Match Extra Ltd—who owned and ran a cricket website of the same name—bought the magazine from the then owners BSkyB. In May 2011, the magazine dropped the 'Wisden' from the masthead and became The Cricketer (in association with Wisden). Stern left as editor later that month. Andrew Miller joined as editor in January 2012, with former Nottinghamshire cricketer Andy Afford appointed as publishing director. Afford soon took on the role of managing director and when Miller departed Simon Hughes, a former Middlesex and Durham bowler, became the title's editor-at-large from 1 September 2014.

"Freies Volk ('Free People') was a newspaper published daily from Düsseldorf, West Germany 1949-1956. Freies Volk was printed at Freier Verlag GmbH, Ackerstrasse 114. The first issue of Freies Volk was published on January 3, 1949. Freies Volk replaced Die Freiheit, an organ of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in Düsseldorf that had been banned in October 1948, following sharp criticisms against the Allied occupation powers. Freies Volk carried the by-line 'People's Newspaper for the Rhine-Westphalian Industrial Region'. On September 1, 1949 Freies Volk became the central organ of the Communist Party. At the time it had a circulation of 80,000. Hugo Erlich was named as the editor in chief of Freies Volk. Publication of Freies Volk was suspended by the Allied occupation authorities in August 1950, following the article \""Now It's Tanks and Poison Gas instead of Cigarettes | Bonn as Go-Between in US Arms Trade\"". Publication of the newspaper was resumed in November 1950. In 1951 Franz Ahrens became the editor in chief of Freies Volk. In mid-1954 Fritz Bäsel was appointed editor in chief of the newspaper.

"Freies Volk ('Free People') was a newspaper published daily from Düsseldorf, West Germany 1949-1956. Freies Volk was printed at Freier Verlag GmbH, Ackerstrasse 114. The first issue of Freies Volk was published on January 3, 1949. Freies Volk replaced Die Freiheit, an organ of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in Düsseldorf that had been banned in October 1948, following sharp criticisms against the Allied occupation powers. Freies Volk carried the by-line 'People's Newspaper for the Rhine-Westphalian Industrial Region'. On September 1, 1949 Freies Volk became the central organ of the Communist Party. At the time it had a circulation of 80,000. Hugo Erlich was named as the editor in chief of Freies Volk. Publication of Freies Volk was suspended by the Allied occupation authorities in August 1950, following the article \""Now It's Tanks and Poison Gas instead of Cigarettes | Bonn as Go-Between in US Arms Trade\"". Publication of the newspaper was resumed in November 1950. In 1951 Franz Ahrens became the editor in chief of Freies Volk. In mid-1954 Fritz Bäsel was appointed editor in chief of the newspaper.

"Makhi (Greek: Μάχη, meaning \""Battle\"" or \""Struggle\"") is a Greek-language Cypriot daily newspaper with close affiliation to radical right-wing and nationalist ideas. It was founded in 1960 by journalist and former EOKA gunman Nikos Sampson, as the voice of his \""Progressive Front\"", a nationalist party. Historically it has expressed the Enosis view, urging for a complete union to motherland Greece and with a strong anti-colonialist, anti-marxist and anti-Turkish orientation. During the Grivas-Makarios controversy, which dominated the Cypriot politics in the early 1970s, the newspaper fully supported Georgios Grivas and EOKA-B against Archbishop Makarios III, who held the presidency and was seen by Greek military junta of 1967-1974 as a pro-communist. The events of 1974, which culminated in the Turkish invasion of Cyprus isolated Sampson's followers and the newspaper lost nearly all the political influence it had once gathered. In the late 1990s the paper has moderated its views, and supported Glafkos Clerides and the Democratic Rally party. It is now owned by Sotiris Sampson, son of Nikos Sampson, who is a member of the Cyprus parliament. Without abandoning its nationalist view, the paper nowadays reflects the views of Democratic Rally (DISY) dissidents who were opposed to the Annan Plan, against party consensus. It also staunchly opposes the entrance of Turkey to the European Union, and supports the full withdrawal of the Turkish armed forces from the occupied Cypriot territory, either through diplomacy or though military action.",history,2765_ancient.png,1

"Femme Fatales is an American men's magazine focusing on film and television actresses. Femme Fatales was founded by Frederick S. Clarke in the summer of 1992, as the sister publication of his science fiction film magazine Cinefantastique. Published by Clarke, it was originally edited by pin-up photography collector and expert Bill George. Cinefantanstique contributor Dan Cziraky joined the staff as Associate Editor several months prior to its launch. It focused on science-fiction, fantasy, and horror actresses, from B-movies to Academy Award winners, featuring provocative non-nude photography pictorials, alongside extensive career interviews. It was unique in that it encouraged contributions from the actresses themselves, and featured articles penned by \""scream queens\"" Brinke Stevens ,Tina-Desiree Berg and Debbie Rochon, amongst others. Interviews with filmmakers that helped bolster the \""scream queen\"" market, such as Andy Sidaris and Fred Olen Ray, were also featured. It was a publishing success, at one time producing an issue every three weeks. Cziraky left the magazine in 1994 over creative differences with George, and was replaced as Associate Editor by Rochon. Clarke committed suicide in 2000, and for two years, both magazines were published by his widow, Celeste Casey Clarke. At the end of 2002, Femme Fatales was published bi-monthly, and had an unaudited circulation of 70,000. In 2002, Clarke contacted Mark A. Altman, the president and chief operating officer of Mindfire Entertainment, a film/TV writer and producer, the former editor-in-chief of Sci-Fi Universe and a regular contributor to both Cinefantastique and Femme Fatales, allowing Mindfire to take over their publication. David E. Williams, a former executive features editor at The Hollywood Reporter, became editor-in-chief of both publications. Both magazines' operations were moved from Chicago to Culver City. Williams planned the 2003 revamp of Femme Fatales as a version of the men's magazine Maxim focusing on actresses in science fiction and horror films. After a brief hiatus, Mark Gottwald took over publication and Femme Fatales began printing again in at the end of 2007 as a bi-monthly magazine. The final issue of Femme Fatales was printed in September of 2008 and featured Jolene Blalock on the cover. Femme Fatales was purchased by Williams in 2010.

"Fast Forward Weekly (FFWD) was a news and entertainment weekly which provides news, alternative viewpoints, entertainment information, review articles and specialized advertising. It is distributed throughout Calgary, Banff and Canmore. It is owned by Great West Newspapers, LP. With an assessed readership of 70,000 upon a distributed circulation of 30,000, the paper is one of the most widely circulated and well-respected alternative newspapers in Canada. The paper originated in December 1995 as the city's first alternative weekly publication. As of 2007, it is the only freely distributed weekly newspaper of its type in the city, having outlasted a number of competitors including a short-lived Calgary edition of The Georgia Straight which had originally been called VOX, the long-running Calgary Mirror (which folded in 2001), and the Mirror's successor, FYI Calgary In-Print, which ran for only five months in 2001. While the paper was initially arts-focused, in recent years it has been covering more news stories and social issues. In 2008, the paper was criticized over publishing a controversial article quoting Calgary Conservative MP Lee Richardson on comments regarding immigrants and crime which he later stated he regretted; clarifying he was referring only to youth gangs in the city. Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper called the reporting \""gotcha journalism\"" for taking his comments out of their intended context, while other party leaders called for his resignation. One of Fast Forward's most popular editions is its annual Best of Calgary readers' poll. For this, readers voluntarily submit their responses to a large variety of questions, indicating their favourite (or least favourite) aspects of Calgary, including its food, people, culture, infrastructure, political leadership and more.

"Total Carp is a magazine published in the UK by David Hall Publishing Ltd (Editor Marc Coulson), containing mostly articles of interest to carp fishermen. The Complete History Of Total Carp Magazine To understand the complete history of Total Carp, the world's biggest-selling carp fishing magazine, you have to travel back in time to 1996 when Jim Foster first joined DHP as deputy editor of Catchmore Carp. DHP bought Catchmore Carp from its previous owner and publisher Tim Hodges, who stayed on board as editor for a short period. The aim was to develop it into a top-selling title that would rival the likes of Advanced Carp Fishing and Carpworld, the most successful carp titles in that sector of publishing at the time. There was a problem, though. Catchmore Carp was a failing title when DHP purchased it. Sales prior to DHP acquiring Catchmore in 1996 were not great and the magazine had a poor reputation among its target readership. So in 1999 the magazine relaunched as Total Carp and all set goals were achieved in the first three years of the magazine's existence. Jim still remembers the day that Simon McKeown, DHP's circulation manager at the time, came into the office and congratulated him. Jim asked what the congratulations were for, and Simon said that Total Carp had sold more than 20,000 copies in a month for the first time. It was the first carp magazine ever to do this. In 2003, Jim's time as editor of TC was over and Marc Coulson took the reins. Under his focused leadership the magazine has continued to grow and get better still. Now it is bigger than ever (196 pages long in peak months) and has a current accredited ABC circulation of 22,524 copies sold every month. This figure, thanks to the efforts of Marc and his team, is nearly 5,000 copies per month (27 per cent) higher than it was in 2003. The philosophy behind the production of TC remains the same now. DHP was once paid a very high compliment by a magazine guru from publishing giant Emap, who said that Total Carp was 'laser targeted' at its readership. It is, and it will continue to be. Without the efforts of all the people who've worked on the magazine over the years, TC wouldn't be what it is now - the best carp magazine in the world!",history,3062-quote-slides.png,1

"Trondheims-Pressen was a cooperative newspaper published in Trondheim, Norway from May 8 to May 12, 1945 by Arbeider-Avisen, Nidaros and Adresseavisen. The common newspaper was established after the Second World War, when the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian government in exile pressed news agencies to make common newspapers until those that had been discontinued during the German occupation had time to reestablish themselves. The discontinued newspapers were to be allowed to use the production facilities of other newspapers in order to prohibit the latter from gaining a competitive advantage. In Trondheim, two of the three remaining newspapers had been discontinued, namely Arbeider-Avisen and Nidaros. Newspapers that voluntarily allowed themselves be nazified were discontinued, leading to the abandonment of Dagsposten. The resistance movement decided that, as far as possible, the discontinued newspapers were to be common newspapers with neutral names, and that approved editors would be used to meet the enormous demand for information during peacetime. The chosen editors were given ample preparation time because they were informed about this assignment in April. Transition arrangements were made to ensure that journalists from all types of newspapers could both cooperate in printing the common newspapers and plan their own newspapers at the same time. The resistance movement forced the surviving news agencies to make equipment available. Oslo-Pressen was published as a common newspaper in the capital of Oslo, which was given a large amount of attention from journalists, especially on the city's living conditions.

On 17 January 1981, the title again changed, owing to the increasing importance of sell-through videos, to Music & Video Week. The rival Record Business, founded in 1978 by Brian Mulligan and Norman Garrod, was absorbed into Music Week in February 1983.

"Walter George Ball (7 April 1911–18 February 1995) was cartoonist for the Canadian comic strip feature Rural Route, which became a familiar fixture in the Star Weekly between 1956 until the publication's demise in 1968. He was born in Essa, Ontario. Ball, who grew up on a farm near Cookstown, Ontario, originally looked at electrical engineering as a career, but it was his application to the Toronto Daily Star, with only a few sample correspondence school art lessons, that got him hired as a graphic artist in 1932. Early in his tenure at the Star, Ball (not yet a cartoonist) befriended legendary Canadian artist Jimmy Frise, who accepted a more lucrative offer from the Montreal Standard in the late 1940s. When the Star Weekly made a format change from broadsheet to tabloid in 1956, an editor asked Ball if he knew a cartoonist interested in creating a comic feature for the new publication. Ball suggested some names, but having always had a desire to enter the field, worked concurrently on his own strip. It was quickly accepted and one month into the new format, a reader survey indicated Rural Route had become the most read feature in the publication. It was syndicated by Miller Services to other local Canadian newspapers, and it also appeared in several newspapers in the Midwestern United States. Featuring the woodsy adventures of a small town youth named Willie and his farm-dwelling Uncle Elmer and Aunt Myrtle, Ball drew largely on his own childhood farm experiences in creating and developing Rural Route. Ball, Frise and cartoonist Doug Wright are considered to be co-creators of a distinct Canadian comic strip style of that time, with ornately detailed drawings and a simple, folksy humour style. When Rural Route and the Star Weekly folded in 1968, Ball continued in the Star's art department, being promoted to art director in 1970, and retired in 1976. He resided with his wife in the Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill until his death.",art,160796-draw.png,1

It was syndicated by Miller Services to other local Canadian newspapers, and it also appeared in several newspapers in the Midwestern United States. Featuring the woodsy adventures of a small town youth named Willie and his farm-dwelling Uncle Elmer and Aunt Myrtle, Ball drew largely on his own childhood farm experiences in creating and developing Rural Route. Ball, Frise and cartoonist Doug Wright are considered to be co-creators of a distinct Canadian comic strip style of that time, with ornately detailed drawings and a simple, folksy humour style. When Rural Route and the Star Weekly folded in 1968, Ball continued in the Star's art department, being promoted to art director in 1970, and retired in 1976. He resided with his wife in the Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill until his death.",music,160117-brass-band.png,0

"Gilbert Joseph \""Bus\"" Griffiths (1913 – September 25, 2006) was a cartoonist, lumberjack, and fisherman. He was best known for his graphic novel Now You're Logging, published 1978 by Harbour Publishing. Now You're Logging presented, in cartoon form, a complete look at the techniques, tools, and personalities of logging on the West Coast in the 1930s. He began drawing cartoons while working as a logger, doing work for Vancouver's Maple Leaf Publishing during World War II and comic strips about logging for BC Lumberman magazine. He retired from logging in 1961 and began work as a commercial fisherman. In 1972 he began work on Now You're Logging to document logging in the era before modern technology. A complete picture is presented of the techniques and lives of the typical logger of the 1930s, with tree felling and log bucking, high climbers, chasers, choker setters, a hooktender, an accident and rescue in the woods, the use of the crosscut saw, rigging, a spar (tree), log transport on both truck and water, and operation of the steam donkey all shown and explained. This depiction of logging is interwoven with a love story involving one of the loggers and the daughter of a fishing family near their logging camp. The Comics Journal said about the book in 1996: \""a true anomaly: written and drawn by a man with decades of experience in the woods, it's a book with no clear antecedent, more intent on documenting a way of life than telling a story\"", adding \""it might just change your perception of what comics are, what they can do, and why we need them.\"" He also illustrated the children's book Patrick and the Backhoe by Howard White (Nightwood Editions) and Bush Poems by Peter Trower (Harbour Publishing).",art,160753-plan.png,1

Ofsted described the college in the following terms: \""In accordance with section 13 (3) of the Education Act 2005, HMCI is of the opinion that this school requires special measures because it is failing to give its pupils an acceptable standard of education and the persons responsible for leading, managing or governing the school are not demonstrating the capacity to secure the necessary improvement. Leadership and management has also been described as \""inadequate\"". The Governors and Senior Management have a clear commitment to continual and sustained improvement in pupils’ attainment and in the richness of the curriculum the school provides.\"" In February 2008 the college moved into a brand new £17.3 million state-of-the-art building, boasting an ICT rich environment, a £1.2 million sports hall, a 21st-century Business & Enterprise Centre, including its own purpose built restaurant and a fully equipped recording studio for college and community use, together with numerous other specialist facilities. The college is the first secondary school in Stoke-on-Trent (and perhaps England) to benefit from the national programme known as Building Schools for the Future. Following an Ofsted inspection, the school was placed in \""special measures\"". In the report, leadership and management were described as \""inadequate\"" while the teaching was found to be satisfactory, with some outstanding lessons. The college was inspected again on 2 and 3 March 2010 and subsequently came out of \""special measures.\"" The college was inspected again in 2012 and went back into \""special measures.\"" The college was again inspected in June 2013 and is out of \""special measures\"". The college requires improvements according to Ofsted but is making good progress.",astronomy,1448_stars.png,0

The series depicts the simple, everyday life of Momoko Sakura, a young girl everyone calls Maruko, and her family in suburban Japan in the year 1974.

Hitomi's fortune telling powers blossom in Gaea as she becomes the key to awakening Escaflowne and to stopping Zaibach's plans. While the anime series was in production, two very different manga retellings were also developed and released: a shōnen version of the story entitled The Vision of Escaflowne and a shōjo retelling titled Hitomi — The Vision of Escaflowne. In addition, a second shōjo adaptation called Escaflowne — Energist's Memories was released as a single volume in 1997. The story was novelized in a series of six light novels by Yumiko Tsukamoto, Hajime Yatate, and Shoji Kawamori. A movie adaptation, entitled simply Escaflowne, was released on June 24, 2000, but bears only a basic resemblance to the original series. Four CD soundtracks and a drama CD have also been released in relation to the series.",art,160635-balet.png,0

It was the last of nine Block II GPS satellites to be launched, which were the first operational GPS satellites to fly. It was also the last Block II satellite to be retired from service. USA-64 was launched at 21:56:00 UTC on 1 October 1990, atop a Delta II carrier rocket, flight number D199, flying in the 6925 configuration. The launch took place from Launch Complex 17A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and placed USA-64 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into medium Earth orbit using a Star-37XFP apogee motor. On 31 October 1990, USA-64 was in an orbit with a perigee of 19,972 kilometres (12,410 mi), an apogee of 20,390 kilometres (12,670 mi), a period of 717.94 minutes, and 54.9 degrees of inclination to the equator. It operated in slot 5 of plane D of the GPS constellation. The satellite had a mass of 840 kilograms (1,850 lb), and generated 710 watts of power. It had a design life of 7.5 years, and ceased operations on 14 March 2007, having been removed from active service on 17 November 2006 for testing.",astronomy,160561-galaxy.png,1

"Deep Space 1 (DS1) is a spacecraft of the NASA New Millennium Program dedicated to testing a payload of advanced technologies. Launched on 24 October 1998, the Deep Space mission carried out a flyby of asteroid 9969 Braille, which was selected as the mission's science target. Its mission was extended twice to include an encounter with Comet Borrelly and further engineering testing. Problems during its initial stages and with its star tracker led to repeated changes in mission configuration. While the flyby of the asteroid was a partial success, the encounter with the comet retrieved valuable information. Three of twelve technologies on board had to work within a few minutes of separation from the carrier rocket for the mission to continue. The Deep Space series was continued by the Deep Space 2 probes, which were launched in January 1999 piggybacked on the Mars Polar Lander and were intended to strike the surface of Mars (though contact was lost and the mission failed).

"Reticulum II (or Reticulum 2) is an old dwarf galaxy in the Local Group. Reticulum II was discovered in 2015 by analysing images from the Dark Energy Survey. It is elongated, having an axis ratio of 0.6. The size is given by a half light distance of 30 pc. This is too large for it to be a globular cluster. Magnitude Mv is -2.7. The distance is 30 kpc. The galaxy contains some blue horizontal branch stars. Other features visible are a main sequence, and a main sequence turn off, and a red giant branch. It has an unusual enhancement of r-process elements; meaning that gold and europium are extra common in the brightest stars in the galaxy. The implication of the unusual enrichment in elements heavier than zinc, is that the r-process is very rare, and only happened once in this galaxy, possibly by the collision of two neutron stars. Gamma rays mostly with energies between 2 and 10 GeV have been detected by the Fermi satellite. The radiation from Reticulum II is more significant that other dwarf galaxy emissions.

"BeppoSAX was an Italian–Dutch satellite for X-ray astronomy which played a crucial role in resolving the origin of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the most energetic events known in the universe. It was the first X-ray mission capable of simultaneously observing targets over more than 3 decades of energy, from 0.1 to 300 kiloelectronvolts (keV) with relatively large area, good (for the time) energy resolution and imaging capabilities (with a spatial resolution of 1 arc minute between 0.1 and 10 keV). BeppoSAX was a major programme of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) with the participation of the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes (NIVR). The prime contractor for the space segment was Alenia while Nuova Telespazio led the development of the ground segment. Most of the scientific instruments were developed by the Italian National Research Council (CNR) while the Wide Field Cameras were developed by the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON) and the LECS was developed by the astrophysics division of the European Space Agency's ESTEC facility. BeppoSAX was named in honour of the Italian physicist Giuseppe \""Beppo\"" Occhialini. SAX stands for \""Satellite per Astronomia a raggi X\"" or \""Satellite for X-ray Astronomy\"".

"18610 Arthurdent, provisional designation 1998 CC2, is an asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt. It was discovered by a team of German astronomers including Felix Hormuth at Starkenburg Observatory in Heppenheim on 7 February 1998. It is named after Arthur Dent from Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0–3.1 AU once every 1,485 days. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first known precovery image was taken during Palomar's Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) in 1988, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 10 years prior to its discovery. As of 2016, the asteroid's effective size, its composition and albedo, as well as its rotation period and shape remain unknown. Based on an absolute magnitude of 14.3, the asteroid measures between 3 and 8 kilometers in diameter, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25. Since asteroids in the inner main-belt are often of a silicaceous rather than of a carbonaceous composition, with higher albedos, typically around 0.20, the asteroid's diameter is likely to be in the range of 3 to 5 kilometers. The asteroid is named after Arthur Dent, the bewildered hero of Douglas Adams's radio play and book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The naming of the asteroid was announced by the Minor Planet Center in its Minor Planet Circular on 9 May 2001 (M.P.C. 42677). Two days later, Adams died of a heart attack in Santa Barbara, California. The near coincidence of these events led to some media reports of the asteroid naming appearing after Adams's death was reported, and to assumptions that the two events occurred on the same day, even by those connected to the naming. On 14 May 2001, German amateur astronomer Reiner Stoss at the Starkenburg Observatory wrote: \""You may have heard the sad news that Douglas Adams passed away last Friday. By accident on the same day the naming of minor planet (18610) Arthurdent was announced by the Minor Planet Center.

"The Venera-D (Russian: Венера-Д, pronounced [vʲɪˈnʲɛrə ˈdɛ]) probe is a proposed Russian space probe to Venus, to be launched around 2025. Venera-D's prime purpose is to make radar remote-sensing observations around the planet Venus in a manner similar to that of the Venera 15 and Venera 16 probes in the 1980s or the U.S. Magellan in the 1990s, but with the use of more-powerful radar. Venera-D is also intended to map future landing sites. A lander, based on the Venera design, is also planned, capable of surviving for a long duration on the planet's surface.

"The Venera-D (Russian: Венера-Д, pronounced [vʲɪˈnʲɛrə ˈdɛ]) probe is a proposed Russian space probe to Venus, to be launched around 2025. Venera-D's prime purpose is to make radar remote-sensing observations around the planet Venus in a manner similar to that of the Venera 15 and Venera 16 probes in the 1980s or the U.S. Magellan in the 1990s, but with the use of more-powerful radar. Venera-D is also intended to map future landing sites. A lander, based on the Venera design, is also planned, capable of surviving for a long duration on the planet's surface.

Launched on December 4, 1996 by NASA aboard a Delta II booster a month after the Mars Global Surveyor was launched, it landed on July 4, 1997 on Mars's Ares Vallis, in a region called Chryse Planitia in the Oxia Palus quadrangle. The lander then opened, exposing the rover which conducted many experiments on the Martian surface.The mission carried a series of scientific instruments to analyze the Martian atmosphere, climate, geology and the composition of its rocks and soil. It was the second project from NASA's Discovery Program, which promotes the use of low-cost spacecraft and frequent launches under the motto \""cheaper, faster and better\"" promoted by the then administrator, Daniel Goldin. The mission was directed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a division of the California Institute of Technology, responsible for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.

This asteroid is one of very few bodies located in the 2 : 1 mean motion resonance with the gas giant Jupiter. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.5–4.2 AU once every 6 years and 1 month (2,222 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.26 and an inclination of 1° with respect to the ecliptic.

"Alouette 1 is a deactivated Canadian satellite that studied the ionosphere. Launched in 1962, it was Canada's first satellite, and the first satellite constructed by a country other than the Soviet Union or the United States. Canada was the fourth country to operate a satellite, as the British Ariel 1, constructed in the United States by NASA, preceded Alouette 1 by five months. The name \""Alouette\"" came from the French for \""skylark\"" and the French-Canadian folk song of the same name. A key device on Alouette were the radio antennas consisting of thin strips of spring steel bent into a slight U-shape and the rolled up into small disks in a fashion similar to a measuring tape. When triggered, the rotation of the satellite created enough centrifugal force to pull the disk away from the spacecraft body, and the shaping of the metal caused it to unwind into a long spiral. The result was a stiff circular cross-section antenna known as a \""stem\"", for \""storable tubular extendible member\"".",astronomy,1976_mobile.png,1

"Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) (IATA: HRI, ICAO: VCRI) is an international airport serving southeast Sri Lanka. It is located in the town of Mattala, 18 km (11 mi) from Hambantota. It is the first greenfield airport and the second international airport in the country, after Bandaranaike International Airport in Colombo. The airport is named after the Rajapaksa family. MRIA was opened in March 2013 by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who ordered the construction of the airport. Initially, several airlines flew to the airport, including SriLankan Airlines which established a hub. However, due to low demand, most of these airlines left Mattala. As of May 2016, three airlines fly from the airport to destinations within Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates. Due to the low number of flights, it has been proposed to offer long-term aircraft parking services as well as creating flying schools and maintenance services to be offered from the airport.

"Te Anau Aerodrome was established in the 1940s, located beside State Highway 95 just south of the lakeside town. A compacted grass strip of approximately 800m long allowed light aircraft to land. Amphibian aircraft that serviced the lake also used the small airport if weather conditions on the lake were unfavourable. The site was considered too restrictive for larger aircraft to land. A large powerstation project in the 1960s at nearby Lake Manapouri saw a new paved strip built 12km to the south of Te Anau to service the work force. This airport was owned by Mount Cook Airline and was used for their services into the region. Te Anau Aerodrome continued to be used as the 'local' airport with flightseeing, aerial topdressing, and helicopter operations based there. The airport was managed by the Southland District Council. In 2006 the larger Manapouri airport was sold to the Southland District Council, and as this was considered a far better facility, was developed into a full jet capable airport in 2010 and rebranded Manapouri/Te Anau Airport. The Te Anau Aerodrome was closed to the public accordingly and the runway 'disabled' with large 'X' crosses and bollards placed on it. It has now been sold into private property.",engineering,2912_building_plans.png,1

"The Ice Runway (ICAO: NZIR) is the principal runway for the US Antarctic Program during the summer Antarctic field season due to its proximity to McMurdo Station. The other two runways in the area are the snow runway at Williams Field (ICAO: NZWD) and the white ice runway at Pegasus Field (ICAO: NZPG). This runway is capable of handling wheeled aircraft, that have included to date: Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, Lockheed C-130 Hercules and Lockheed P-3 Orion. In the summer season of 2009/2010 the RNZAF trialled a modified Boeing 757 operationally. The intention is to use the Boeing 757 for passenger transport thereby freeing up capacity for C17 cargo space. The annual sea-ice runway for wheeled aircraft is constructed at the start of each season and is used until early December when the sea ice begins to break up. Subsequently flight operations are moved back to Williams Field. Pilots landing C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft on the sea ice runway report that the surface is stable, not unlike landing on concrete. However, the similarity with land bases ends when the jet aircraft rolls to a stop. The nearly 450,000 pound (= 201 tons) weight of the plane, including cargo and passengers, causes it to sink into the ice, albeit only a matter of inches. A laser light is trained on the aircraft to measure the settlement rate.

"Libby Dam is a dam on the Kootenai River in the U.S. state of Montana. Dedicated on August 24, 1975, Libby Dam spans the Kootenai River 17 miles (27 km) upstream from the town of Libby, Montana. Libby Dam is 422 feet (129 m) tall and 3,055 feet (931 m) long. The reservoir behind the dam is Lake Koocanusa; it extends 90 miles (140 km) upriver from the dam and has a maximum depth of about 370 feet (110 m) . Forty-two miles (68 km) of Lake Koocanusa are in British Columbia, Canada. Lake Koocanusa was named for the treaty that was developed between the Kootenai Indians, the Canadian government, and the U.S. government to build the Dam and form the reservoir. It is the fourth dam constructed under the Columbia River Treaty. The Kootenai River is the third largest tributary to the Columbia river, contributing almost 20% of the total water in the lower Columbia. Libby Dam holds back an average of 5,800,000 acre feet (7.2 km3) of water. The consulting architect for the project was Seattle architect Paul Thiry, and the commission for its large granite bas-relief was awarded to sculptor Albert Wein by competition. In order to make way for the dam, the town of Rexford, Montana was relocated and the Flathead Railroad Tunnel was dug. The dam is operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. At full capacity, the dam can pass over 160,000 cubic feet per second (4,500 m3/s) of water. The dam is designed with a selective withdrawal system that allows water passage from various levels of Lake Koocanusa. This allows the dam operators to moderate water temperatures downstream.

"Libby Dam is a dam on the Kootenai River in the U.S. state of Montana. Dedicated on August 24, 1975, Libby Dam spans the Kootenai River 17 miles (27 km) upstream from the town of Libby, Montana. Libby Dam is 422 feet (129 m) tall and 3,055 feet (931 m) long. The reservoir behind the dam is Lake Koocanusa; it extends 90 miles (140 km) upriver from the dam and has a maximum depth of about 370 feet (110 m) . Forty-two miles (68 km) of Lake Koocanusa are in British Columbia, Canada. Lake Koocanusa was named for the treaty that was developed between the Kootenai Indians, the Canadian government, and the U.S. government to build the Dam and form the reservoir. It is the fourth dam constructed under the Columbia River Treaty. The Kootenai River is the third largest tributary to the Columbia river, contributing almost 20% of the total water in the lower Columbia. Libby Dam holds back an average of 5,800,000 acre feet (7.2 km3) of water. The consulting architect for the project was Seattle architect Paul Thiry, and the commission for its large granite bas-relief was awarded to sculptor Albert Wein by competition. In order to make way for the dam, the town of Rexford, Montana was relocated and the Flathead Railroad Tunnel was dug. The dam is operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. At full capacity, the dam can pass over 160,000 cubic feet per second (4,500 m3/s) of water. The dam is designed with a selective withdrawal system that allows water passage from various levels of Lake Koocanusa. This allows the dam operators to moderate water temperatures downstream. The river continues past Bonners Ferry, Idaho to Kootenay Lake and joins the Columbia River. Libby Dam's powerhouse contains five turbines and is capable of generating 600 megawatts. The electricity is managed by the Bonneville Power Administration and services eight states: Montana, Idaho, Washington, Wyoming, California, Utah, Oregon and Nevada.

"The Nimoo Bazgo Power Project is a run-of-the-river power project on the Indus River situated at Alchi village, 75 kilometres (47 mi) from Leh in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The project was conceived on July 1, 2001 and approved on June 8, 2005, and construction began on 23rd Sept, 2006. The project involves construction of a 57-high m (187 ft) concrete dam with five spillway blocks of 13 m (43 ft) each having ogee profile. The Nimoo Bazgo power project envisages utilizing a rated net head of 34 m (112 ft) to generate 239.30 gigawatt-hours (861.5 terajoules) in a 90% dependable year. The project has three surface power units of 15 MW (20,000 hp) each with an total installed capacity of 15 megawatts (20,000 hp). Every unit has a 3.3 m (11 ft) diameter, each 63 m-long (207 ft) penstocks. Each operating unit will be designed for a discharge of 48.7 m3/s (1,720 cu ft/s) and also have transformer yard and switch yard. The project will be connected to the northern grid through a 220 kV transmission line from Leh to Srinagar (the line is scheduled for commissioning with project commissioning). The dam diverts water from the river by a 372 m (1,220 ft) long diversion channel and involves a flooding of only 3.42 km2 (1.32 sq mi). Thus the power density is 13.16 megawatts per square kilometre (13.16 W/m2; 34.1 MW/sq mi).

From August 1940 to December 1940, Tholthorpe was a landing field for Whitley bombers of No. 58 Squadron RAF and No. 51 Squadron RAF based at Linton. From January 1941 to June 1943, Tholthorpe underwent maintenance to upgrade to Class A standards, with three intersecting concrete runways were main 10-28 at 2,000 yards, 06-24 at 1,430 yards and 16-34 at 1,400 yards. Tholthorpe was assigned to No. 6 Group RCAF in June 1943. RCAF squadrons stationed here included No. 434 Squadron, 431 Squadron, 420 Squadron, and 425 Squadron.

A sequel, similar to the original game, Crystal Crazy, was released in 1993. Crystal Quest is also available on game consoles. On February 7, 2006 Crystal Quest was released on Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade. Game Mechanics LLC licensed Crystal Quest and launched on Kickstarter to raise money to create a new version in February 2015.",history,161508-knights.png,0
"Heavy Rain is an interactive drama action-adventure video game developed by Quantic Dream and published by Sony Computer Entertainment exclusively for the PlayStation 3 in February 2010. The game is a film noir thriller, featuring four diverse protagonists involved with the mystery of the Origami Killer, a serial killer who uses extended periods of rainfall to drown his victims. The player interacts with the game by performing actions highlighted on screen related to motions on the controller, and in some cases, performing a series of quick time events during fast-paced action sequences. The player's decisions and actions during the game will affect the narrative. The main characters can be killed, and certain actions may lead to different scenes and endings. Heavy Rain was a critical and commercial success, winning multiple Game of the Year awards and selling over three million copies. A film adaptation of the game is currently in development. A PlayStation 4 version, featuring improved graphics and resolution, was released as both a standalone title and in the Quantic Dream Collection with Beyond: Two Souls, in March 2016.",technology,160971-computer.png,1

"Beyond Good & Evil 2 is a video game in development by Ubisoft Montpellier and published by Ubisoft. It is the sequel or prequel to the 2003 video game Beyond Good & Evil. Intended as the first part of a trilogy, the original Beyond Good & Evil won critical acclaim but failed to gain commercial success. As such, the status of the sequel was unknown for several years until it was unveiled at Ubidays 2008 in the Louvre in Paris, France, on 28 May 2008. Since its first revelation, Beyond Good & Evil 2's development has been characterized in the media by uncertainty, doubt and rumours about the game's future. On 28 May 2010, a French website claimed to have insider information of Michel Ancel leaving Ubisoft Montpellier, thus putting the game on hold. However this was denied by Ubisoft representatives shortly thereafter. Appearing at the Montpellier in Game conference on 25 June 2010, Ancel stated that the game is in development and that they are experimenting with new development practices to keep the development team small and preserve its artistic spirit. As such, the development will take \""a while\"", but Ancel encouraged listeners to be patient. In 2011, it was revealed that Ancel and his team took a break from the development of the game to work on Rayman Origins. Speaking at an exclusive Ubisoft dinner in 2011, Ancel stated that Beyond Good & Evil 2 was far into development and targeting a release on the next generation of consoles. No more infomation came out on the development of Beyond Good & Evil 2 until 2016. The product said to be released on next gen consoles was never released. Ancel has said that Beyond Good & Evil 2 is being developed from scratch and it is not expected to be released for a few more years at least.

"No Man's Sky is an action-adventure survival video game developed and published by the indie studio Hello Games for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows. The game was released worldwide in August 2016. The gameplay of No Man's Sky is built on four pillars: exploration, survival, combat, and trading. Players are free to perform within the entirety of a procedurally generated deterministic open universe, which includes over 18 quintillion (1.8×) planets, many with their own sets of flora and fauna. Players participate in a shared universe, with the ability to exchange planet information with other players, though the game is also fully playable offline; this is enabled by the procedural generation system that assures players find the same planet with the same features, lifeforms, and other aspects once given the planet coordinates, requiring no further data to be stored or retrieved from game servers. Nearly all elements of the game are procedurally generated, including star systems, planets and their ecosystems, flora, fauna and their behavioural patterns, artificial structures, and alien factions and their spacecraft. The founder of Hello Games, Sean Murray, had wanted to create a game that captured the sense of exploration and optimism of science fiction writings and art of the 1970s and 1980s with No Man's Sky. The title was developed over three years by a small team at Hello Games with promotional and publishing help from Sony Interactive Entertainment. The British band 65daysofstatic assisted in developing the game's music, with sound designer Paul Weir developing systems to procedurally generate the soundtrack. Significant attention and expectations were given to the title in the months leading to its release, leading Murray and some journalists to recommend caution due to the indie nature and niche appeal of the title, seeking to avoid the pitfalls that had previously occurred at the launch of Spore in 2008. At release, the game received a wide range of mixed reviews, praising the technical achievements of the procedurally-generated universe, while considering the gameplay lackluster and repetitive. No Man's Sky also suffered several technical problems at launch, while lacking several marketed features, including a multiplayer element, that further marred the players' experience with the game. Hello Games has expressed commitment to fixing technical issues with the release as well as plans to expand features of the game in time, but otherwise has not communicated with the community following the release window, further straining reactions from players. Though the game was a top retail and digital seller in August 2016 in both the United Kingdom and North America, player interest quickly waned at a faster-than-normal rate and perception of the title plummeted to an overwhelmingly negative level in the months following release. The promotion and marketing hype for No Man's Sky has become a subject of debate, with at least one advertising industry group reviewing their materials for any potential breaches and false advertising.",technology,2716_cyberspace.png,1

Left 4 Dead 2 builds upon cooperatively focused gameplay and Valve's proprietary Source engine, the same game engine used in the original Left 4 Dead. Set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, Left 4 Dead 2 focuses on four new Survivors, fighting against hordes of zombies, known as the Infected, who develop severe psychosis and act extremely aggressive. The Survivors must fight their way through five campaigns, interspersed with safe houses that act as checkpoints, with the goal of escape at each campaign's finale. The gameplay is procedurally altered by the \""AI Director 2.0\"", which monitors the players' performance and adjusts the scenario to provide a dynamic challenge.

It attracted an unusually high volume of pre-release controversy about the game's graphic content.

"Cow Clicker is an incremental social network game on Facebook developed by video game researcher Ian Bogost. The game serves as a deconstructive satire of social games. The goal of the game is to earn \""clicks\"" by clicking on a sprite of a cow every six hours. The addition of friends' cows to the player's pasture allows the user to also receive \""clicks\"" whenever the player's cow is clicked. A premium currency known as \""Mooney\"" allows the user to purchase different cow designs and skip the six-hour interval between clicks. In the wake of a controversial speech by Zynga's president at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2010, Bogost developed Cow Clicker for a presentation at a New York University seminar on social gaming in July 2010. The game was created to demonstrate what Bogost felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of social games, such as the promotion of social interaction and monetization rather than the artistic aspects of the medium. As the game unexpectedly began to grow in popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming trends, such as gamification, educational apps, and alternate reality games. Some critics praised Cow Clicker for its dissection of the common mechanics of social network games and viewed it as a commentary on how social games affect people.",technology,161722-industry.png,1

"Evolve is a first-person shooter video game developed by Turtle Rock Studios, published by 2K Games and distributed by Take-Two Interactive. Announced in January 2014 and originally set to be released in late 2014, the game was delayed and released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in February 2015. Evolve uses an asymmetrical structure where five players, four playing as hunters and one as the monster, battle against each other in an industrialized alien planet called Shear. The hunters' gameplay is based on the first-person shooter design, while the monsters are controlled from a third-person perspective. The hunters' goal is to eliminate the monster, while the monster's goal is to consume wildlife and evolve to make themselves stronger. The game can be played alone or with multiple players. Evolve was Turtle Rock Studios' first major project after the company split from Valve Corporation in 2011. The concept for Evolve existed prior to the development of their previous game, Left 4 Dead. Inspired by hunting games such as Cabela's Big Game Hunter and Deer Hunter, the idea is to have prey that can strike back at the hunters. The monster design was originally intended to be esoteric but was later toned down. The game is powered by Crytek's CryEngine, as they believed that the engine is capable of creating the dark and dense forests featured in the game. Turtle Rock Studios found difficulty when seeking publishers that could provide funding and marketing for the game. THQ was originally set to serve as the game's publisher, but the rights to the franchise and publishing duties were transferred to Take-Two Interactive after THQ filed for bankruptcy in late 2012. Prior to release, Evolve received a largely positive reception and won the Best of Show Awards at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 and Gamescom 2014. The game was tested by the general public multiple times. Upon release, the game received positive reviews from critics, with praise mostly directed to the game's atmosphere, asymmetrical structure, controls, and designs. However, it received criticism for its progression system and light narrative, as well as a large amount of downloadable content prepared. Evolve is a commercial success, with Take-Two's CEO saying that the property would be a permanent franchise for them. In July 2016, it was announced that Evolve would be transitioning to become free-to-play, due to the mixed post-release reception and the DLC controversy.",technology,161663-online.png,1

Mega Man Anniversary Collection contains the first eight games in the original Mega Man series, which debuted on the Nintendo Entertainment System with the first six games, moved to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System with the seventh game, and then moved again to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn with the eighth game. The plot follows the robotic protagonist Mega Man in his continuing adventures battling the evil Dr. Wily and his army of Robot Masters. Each game has a nearly identical structure in which the player traverses a series of themed stages to face off against boss robots, gain new weapons and abilities, then defeat Dr. Wily in a final confrontation. An extra feature is the \""Navi Mode\"" for the first six titles, which provides hints and pathways for completing each stage.

"Myst III: Exile is the third title in the Myst series of graphic adventure puzzle video games. While the preceding games in the series, Myst and Riven, were produced by Cyan Worlds and published by Brøderbund, Exile was developed by Presto Studios and published by Ubisoft. The game was released on four compact discs for both Mac OS and Microsoft Windows on May 8, 2001; versions for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 were released in late 2002. As in previous games, the player assumes the role of the Stranger, a friend of Atrus. A member of the D'ni race, Atrus can create links to other worlds called Ages by writing descriptive books. In Exile, Atrus has written an Age for the D'ni to live on while rebuilding their civilization; it is stolen, however, by a mysterious figure. The Stranger pursues the thief in an attempt to reclaim Atrus' book. The creators of the Myst franchise gave the task of creating the third Myst game to Presto Studios, known for its adventure game series The Journeyman Project. Presto sought to develop a diverse and logical approach to puzzles and Ages, and worked to make the villain sympathetically multifaceted. The developers hired Jack Wall to develop a musical style different from earlier composer Robyn Miller but still recognizable as a Myst game. The project required millions of U.S. dollars and more than two years to complete. Exile was received well by critics; The Daily Telegraph called it the best game in the Myst series. Conversely, long-time critics of the series complained that Exile continued to prove that Myst's slower gameplay did not belong in the fast-paced modern game market; GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin described the Myst series as having lost its relevance. Despite selling more than one million copies within the first year of release, Exile fared poorer commercially than Myst and Riven, which had sold more than 10 million copies combined. Myst IV: Revelation, the fourth game in the series, was developed and published solely by Ubisoft.",technology,161662-seminar.png,1

"(This article is about the video game. For the 1982 science fiction novel, see The Pillars of Eternity.) Pillars of Eternity is a role-playing video game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Paradox Interactive. It was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on March 26, 2015. The game is a spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series, along with Planescape: Torment. Obsidian started a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter for it in September 2012. The campaign raised over US$4 million, which was the highest funded video game at the time. The game uses the Unity engine. The game takes place in the fantasy world of Eora, mainly inside the nation of Dyrwood. The infants in the Dyrwood are plagued by a recent phenomenon in which they become \""hollowborn\"" upon birth, meaning they are born with no soul. During the beginning of the game, the protagonist experiences an awakening of power due to a disastrous supernatural event, discovering they are a \""Watcher\"": a person who can see past lives and interact with souls. The objective of the game is to find out what caused their awakening and how to solve the hollowborn problem. Pillars of Eternity received critical acclaim upon its release; many critics praised the game for its world and immersive writing, along with the strategic combat, and also said that it is a worthy successor to the games it was inspired by. The game also won various awards and accolades, including best RPG of 2015.

"FIFA Manager (short: FIFAM) was an association football series of sport management games published by Electronic Arts. The games were developed by the German studio Bright Future GmbH and EA Sports. The game was called Total Club Manager (short: TCM) until the name changed to FIFA Manager with the FIFAM 06. It was announced FIFA Manager's last installment was FIFA Manager 14 and that there would be no further editions to the game. Before FIFAM and TCM, EA Sports released FIFA Soccer Manager (1997) and The FA Premier League Football Manager 99, 2000, 2001 and 2002, but while the first managed to attract some attention, the latter were released when the managing games market for non-Championship Manager titles was close to non-existent, and after two unsuccessful titles, it was dropped. However, by 2001, several employees of German software house Ascaron, who developed the highly popular Anstoss series in the past moved to EA, and the first game, Fussball Manager 2002, was released in Germany only, as a test for a potential series. It resembled Anstoss 3, although on a more serious note (in Anstoss, players could be abducted by aliens, train in Area 51 or use performance-enhancing drugs) and fewer financial options (managers developed by German teams often include deep financial options, such as stock and real estate markets). The game had positive reception, and a year later Total Club Manager 2003 was released, with Bobby Robson on the cover (for the second time, after FIFA Soccer Manager). One of the key features of Anstoss 3 was the ability to actually play the games after Anstoss Action was released. Although it could be played as a stand-alone game, it only reached the full potential when used with the manager game. This feature, only present on other games with limited geographical distribution, the Spanish PC Fútbol, was included for buyers of both TCM 2004 and FIFA 2004, which could use the Football Fusion function. Some fans managed to control games in TCM 2003 by hacking the configuration files, but data loss and corruption was frequent. Celtic manager Martin O'Neill appeared on the cover of TCM 2004. Criticized by a confusing interface, EA reworked it for TCM 2005, with a more sleek design. European Champion with former FC Porto and Chelsea manager José Mourinho was selected for the main cover. While the TCM series has been released for Windows, Xbox and PlayStation 2, the FIFAM series is only available for Windows. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of the game were developed for EA Canada by Budcat Creations.",technology,1900_information.png,1
