"Stingrays are a group of rays, which are cartilaginous fish related to sharks. They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes and consist of eight families: Hexatrygonidae (sixgill stingray), Plesiobatidae (deepwater stingray), Urolophidae (stingarees), Urotrygonidae (round rays), Dasyatidae (whiptail stingrays), Potamotrygonidae (river stingrays), Gymnuridae (butterfly rays), and Myliobatidae (eagle rays). Most stingrays have one or more barbed stingers (modified from dermal denticles) on the tail, which are used exclusively in self-defense. The stinger may reach a length around 35 cm (14 in), and its underside has two grooves with venom glands. The stinger is covered with a thin layer of skin, the integumentary sheath, in which the venom is concentrated. A few members of the suborder, such as the manta and porcupine rays, do not have stingers. Stingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world. Some species, such as Dasyatis thetidis, are found in warmer temperate oceans, and others, such as Plesiobatis daviesi, are found in the deep ocean. The river stingrays, and a number of whiptail stingrays (such as the Niger stingray), are restricted to fresh water. Most myliobatoids are demersal (inhabiting the next-to-lowest zone in the water column), but some, such as the pelagic stingray and the eagle rays, are pelagic. While most stingrays are relatively widespread and not currently threatened, for several species (for example Taeniura meyeni, D. colarensis, D. garouaensis, and D. laosensis), conservation status is more problematic, leading to their being listed as vulnerable or endangered by IUCN. The status of several other species is poorly known, leading to their being listed as data deficient.",nature,7

"Lake Natron is a salt and soda lake in the Arusha Region of northern Tanzania. The lake is close to the Kenyan border and is in the Gregory Rift, which is the eastern branch of the East African Rift. The lake is within the Lake Natron Basin, a Ramsar Site wetland of international significance. The lake is fed principally by the Southern Ewaso Ng'iro River, which rises in central Kenya, and by mineral-rich hot springs. It is quite shallow, less than three metres (9.8 ft) deep, and varies in width depending on its water level. The lake is a maximum of 57 kilometres (35 mi) long and 22 kilometres (14 mi) wide. The surrounding area receives irregular seasonal rainfall, mainly between December and May totalling 800 millimetres (31 in) per year. Temperatures at the lake are frequently above 40 °C (104 °F). High levels of evaporation have left behind natron (sodium carbonate decahydrate) and trona (sodium sesquicarbonate dihydrate). The alkalinity of the lake can reach a pH of greater than 12. The surrounding bedrock is composed of alkaline, sodium-dominated trachyte lavas that were laid down during the Pleistocene period. The lavas have significant amounts of carbonate but very low calcium and magnesium levels. This has allowed the lake to concentrate into a caustic alkaline brine.",nature,7

"Cheirolepidiaceae is a family of extinct coniferous plants. This family of conifers, superficially similar to Cupressaceae, was a significant part of the flora of the Mesozoic, around 252 to 66 million years ago (Axsmith et al., 2004). They are united by the possession of a distinctive pollen type assigned to the form genus Classopollis. The name Frenelopsidaceae (as a separate family) or \""frenelopsids\"" has been used for a group of Cheirolepidiaceae with jointed stems, thick internode cuticles, sheathing leaf bases and reduced free leaf tips.

"The Oceanic eclectus parrot  (Eclectus infectus) is an extinct parrot species which occurred on Tonga, Vanuatu and possibly on Fiji. The only living relative in the genus is the eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) which has proportionally larger wings than the Oceanic eclectus parrot. The fossil material unearthed in November 1989 in Late Pleistocene and Holocene deposits on 'Eua, Lifuka, 'Uiha and Vanuatu and described in 2006 by David William Steadman include a complete femur, five radii, a quadrate bone, a mandible, a coracoid, two sterna, two humeri, two ulnae, two tibiotarsi, a carpometacarpus, a tarsometatarsus, and three pedal phalanges. The Oceanic eclectus parrot became extinct on Tonga during the early settlement 3000 years ago, presumably due to human-caused factors. On Vava'u, it may have survived into historic times because among the drawings which were created in 1793 during Alessandro Malaspina's Pacific expedition, there is one sketch which appears to portray an Oceanic eclectus parrot.",nature,7

"Prejanopterus is an extinct genus of pterodactyloid pterosaur from the Lower Cretaceous (lower Aptian age) layers of the Leza Formation of La Rioja, Spain. In 1980 a fossil site was discovered near Yacimiento de Fuente Amarga on the western slopes of the Peña Isasa. In 1993 and 1994 ten fossiliferous blocks were recovered, containing numerous disarticulated fossil bones and bone fragments, among them those of a pterosaur. The type species Prejanopterus curvirostra was named and described in 2010 by Carolina Fuentes Vidarte and Manuel Meijide Calvo. The generic name is derived from the village of Préjano and a Latinised Greek pteron, \""wing\"". The specific name is derived from Latin curvus, \""bent\"", and rostrum, \""snout\"", a reference to the distinctive bend to the left which was claimed to be present in all fossils of the snout. A later study indicates that \""there is no genuine sideways bend\"" of the snout, \""but a slight dorsal curvature\"". The same study emended the specific name to curvirostris as the feminine curvirostra had been incorrect. The holotype, F. A. 112, consists of a fragmented snout. Another snout, specimen F. A. 185, is the paratype. Numerous other elements of the skull and the postcrania have been assigned to the species, mostly from the wing, the pelvis and the hindlimbs. A humerus or vertebrae are still lacking. The species represents the best preserved pterosaur known from Spain and the first named from the Early Cretaceous of that country. The bent snout features twenty pairs of small teeth with an oval cross-section. That the curvature is no preservation artefact, a post mortem distortion, is indicated by the fact that both known snouts show it. Remarkably, all lower jaws found are straight. The wing span was initially estimated at 4.26 metres (14.0 ft); however, later studies indicate that the wing span of Prejanopterus was probably not much (if ever) in excess of 2 metres (6.6 ft). The authors have assigned Prejanopterus to the Pterodactyloidea. Using the comparative method they established that no pterodactyloid group has obvious strong affinities to the species. In a later phylogenetic study Pereda-Suberbiola et al. (2012) recovered Prejanopterus as a ctenochasmatoid \""positioned between Pterodactylus and Cycnorhamphus-Gallodactylus\"". A more recent phylogenetic study recovers it as a possible lonchodectid. Cladogram after Pereda-Suberbiola et al. (2012):",nature,7
"Micrurapteryx caraganella is a moth of the Gracillariidae family. It is found in Siberia, and possibly Tajikistan and the Russian Far East. The wingspan is 8.7–10.2 mm.

"The long-tailed widowbird (Euplectes progne), also known as the “Sakabula,” is a species of bird in the Ploceidae family. The species are found in Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Lesotho, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and southern Zaire. The long-tailed widowbird is a medium-sized bird and one of the most common in the territories it inhabits. Adult breeding males are almost entirely black with orange and white shoulders (epaulets), long, wide tails, and a bluish white bill. Females are rather inconspicuous, their feathers streaked tawny and black with pale patches on the chest, breast and back, narrow tail feathers, and horn-color bills. When flying, male long-tailed widowbirds are readily visible due to their extremely long tails. Between six and eight of their twelve tail feathers are approximately half a metre (approximately 20 inches) long. The tail during flight display is expanded vertically into a deep, long keel below the male as he flies with slow wingbeats 0.5 to 2 metres (20 to 78 inches) above his territory. Because of the seemingly large cost to such male ornaments, the long-tailed widowbird has been the subject of extensive research into the function and evolution of sexually selected traits. This research has demonstrated the existence of female choice in sexual selection and indicates the trade-offs between sexual appeal and physical constraints with regard to the evolution of sexual ornaments.",nature,7

"Taruga is the only foam-nesting tree frog in the Old World Tree frog family (Rhacophoridae) that is endemic to Sri Lanka. Genus Taruga was previously assigned to the genus Polypedates. As presently understood, Taruga comprises three named species: T. fastigo, T. eques and T. longinasus. Hence two genera of foam-nesting rhacophorid tree frogs are present in Sri Lanka: (1) Polypedates, with many species in India and Asia but just two in Sri Lanka (P. maculatus— widely distributed in South Asia; and P. cruciger— endemic to Sri Lanka, albeit widely distributed); and (2) Taruga, the Sri Lankan endemic forms, whose three constituent species (T. eques, T. fastigo and T. longinasus) each have restricted distributions mostly in the forested highlands. The best character to distinguish the adults of Taruga from Polypedates are a set of prominent cone-like projections around the vent. Furthermore, the supratympanic fold of Taruga is straighter than those in Polypedates. The snout of Taruga is very much acute than that of Polypedates. Considering tadpoles, the vent of Polypedates forms a tube between left leg and tail, and in Taruga, there is no such tube, only an opening between leg and tail. There are also several more features of the mouth cavity, such as the number of projections on the tongue, shape of the tongue etc. that helps to distinguish Taruga from Polypedates. Taruga in Sanskrit (and early-Sinhala) means \""tree climber\"". This name is very appropriate as the adults of these are tree inhabiting frogs, and rarely come to the ground. They often even lay their eggs on vegetation overhanging water. All three frogs need shade in the form of a canopy to survive, and shallow and slow flowing streams or puddles to breed. The female of the species builds a foamy nest overhanging water where eggs develop for a few days, after which tadpoles fall into water where they undergo further development until metamorphosis occurs. The juvenile frogs that emerge from water return to an arboreal life, on trees. Sri Lanka is now known to contain clade level endemicity despite many land-bridge connections with India. Taruga is yet another such deeply divergent clade.

"Sciadopitys verticillata, koyamaki, or Japanese umbrella-pine, is a unique conifer endemic to Japan. It is the sole member of the family Sciadopityaceae and genus Sciadopitys, a living fossil with no close relatives, and known in the fossil record for about 230 million years. Its genus name comes from the Greek prefix sciado- meaning \""shadow\"" and pitys, meaning \""pine\""; the specific epithet means \""with whorls\"". It is an evergreen tree that can grow 15–27 m tall, with brown main shoots bearing whorls of 7–12 cm long flexible green cladodes that look like, and perform the function of, leaves but are actually composed of stem tissues; occasionally, a cladode will be forked and produce a bud in the 'v' of the fork. The cones are 6–11 cm long, mature in about 18 months, and have flattish scales that open to release the seeds. It is a very attractive tree and is popular in gardens, despite its slow growth rate. Koyamaki was chosen as the Japanese Imperial crest for Prince Hisahito of Akishino, currently third in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne.

"A hybrid striped bass, also known as a wiper or whiterock bass, is a hybrid between the striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and the white bass (M. chrysops). It can be distinguished from the striped bass by broken rather than solid horizontal stripes on the body. Hybrid striped bass are considered better suited for culture in ponds than either parent species because they are more resilient to extremes of temperature and to low dissolved oxygen. They became part of aquaculture in the United States in the late 1980s. Most producers purchase the fish young (as fry or fingerlings) and raise them in freshwater ponds. Currently, about 10 million lb (4.5 million kg) are produced annually in the United States. Hybrid striped bass are used both as a gamefish and a food fish. Hybrid striped bass are produced two different ways. Some of these fish are produced by fertilizing eggs from white bass with sperm from striped bass; the resulting fish are also called \""sunshine bass\"" or \""Cherokee bass\"". Others are produced by fertilizing eggs from striped bass with sperm from white bass; the resulting fish is called a \""palmetto bass\"". Hybrid striped bass are known for aggressive feeding habits which makes them highly sought-after by anglers. Often schooling by the thousands, these stocked fish surface feed on baitfish such as shad. Often called \""breaking\"", this surface feeding makes the fish visible and easy to catch on a wide array of lures and baits. Popular lures include casting spoons, buck-tail jigs, soft-body plastic fish replicas, and inline spinners. Their quality as a hard-fighting gamefish is closely followed by their delicious firm, white, flaky meat. Many restaurants sell \""striped bass\"" on their menus, but these are farm-raised hybrid striped bass. Origins are from 1970's, when the first hybrids were stocked in Cherokee Lake in Tennessee. They became known as Cherokee bass, but most commonly are called 'hybrid' (Southeast) or 'wiper' (Midwest). They are stocked in dozens of large impoundments to control baitfish populations and provide sport for anglers. Produced in hatcheries, the most common hybridization is the female striped bass Morone saxatilis and the male white bass M. chrysops. This is due to the high number of eggs produced by the female striped bass. This hybrid cross, palmetto bass, typically produces a faster-growing offspring which attains larger size than the sunshine bass. The female striped bass is injected with human gonadotropin which stimulates her to lay. Usually, around a dozen male white bass are in the tank when the spawn occurs. Once the eggs are fertilized, the brood fish are removed and the eggs must stay adrift in artificial current for about 48 hours to hatch. Natural hybridization occurs between the species, but it is usually the reverse cross which would be male M. saxatilis x female M. chrysops, since the white bass eggs do not require the same degree of flotation to hatch. Their main diet includes shad, bluegill, sunfish, fathead minnows, and black and white crappie.",nature,7

"Mississippi Lake is a lake in Lanark County in Ontario, Canada. Ontario's Mississippi River flows northeast and north through the lake. Several small creeks including Cranberry Creek, McCrearys Creek, and McGibbon Creek drain into the lake from adjoining forest and agricultural land. The lake is distinctive for having one side (to the north) that is part of the Canadian shield, while the other is mostly limestone. The lake is a remnant of the old Champlain Sea, which flooded eastern Ontario at the end of last ice age. The former shoreline of the sea can still be traced inland from the north shore of the lake. European settlement of the lake basin began ca. 1816 as settlers moved north of the Rideau into areas such as Franktown. Between the 1860s and 1920s there were steamboats linking Carleton Place to Innisville. The lake has two large and provincially significant wetlands. The larger occurs at the west end of the lake; here the Mississippi River enters the lake through the Innisville wetland, which is also one of the largest wetlands in Lanark County, and is designated an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest. Included within its boundaries is The Mississippi Lake National Wildlife Area. This wetland has large areas of silver maple swamp, flooded only in the spring, and, lower on the shore, important areas of marsh and aquatic vegetation. The western shore of the lake, including Kinch Bay, Code Bay and King Bay, also supports a diverse wetland which ranges from silver maple swamp to large areas of aquatic plants. Loons, bald eagles, osprey and herons are frequently sighted in these habitats. The ospreys and herons also breed inland from the lake, for example in the nearby Scotch Corners Wetland. The provincially significant Blanding's Turtle is known from the lake; its long-term survival likely depends upon sufficient nesting areas. Eels were once abundant, but hydroelectric dams downstream have all but eliminated this species from the lake and the watershed.",nature,7
"The Kerner grape is an aromatic white grape variety. It was bred in 1929 by August Herold by crossing Trollinger (a red variety also known as Schiava grossa or Vernatsch) and Riesling. Herold was working at a plant breeding station in Lauffen in the Württemberg region of Germany. This station belonged to a state breeding institute headquartered in Weinsberg. It received varietal protection and was released for general cultivation in 1969. Kerner has been named in honour of a poet and physician from Swabia, Justinus Kerner, whose works included songs and poetry on wine. Kerner lived from 1818 to his death in Weinsberg. In 2006 Kerner was the 8th most planted variety in Germany with 4,004 hectares (9,890 acres) and 3.9% of the total vineyard surface. The trend since the mid-1990s is that German plantations of Kerner decrease, just as the case for all other \""new breeds\"" of white varieties, such as Müller-Thurgau and Bacchus. German plantations of Kerner reached their highest point around 1990, with around 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) and 7.5% of the total German vineyard surface. For a while around 1995 it was in fact the third most planted variety in Germany after Riesling and Müller-Thurgau. Kerner is most commonly planted in the German regions of Palatinate, Rheinhessen, Mosel, and Württemberg, but it is also grown in Austria (Styria), Switzerland and the Italian province of South Tyrol. It was introduced into South Tyrol in the early 1970s and awarded Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) status in 1993.",nature,7

"The Barrens topminnow (Fundulus julisia) is a species of freshwater fish in the Fundulidae family, which is in need of management so that it may continue to and increasingly survive in the wild. There are many potential causes of decline of this species including the invasive western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) that will replace native species on a population level, wadding piscivorous birds preying on adults, and the overall restricted distribution of the species. Managing for this species is vital for its success, but to do so there must be an understanding of the species' characteristics. It is endemic to a small portion of Tennessee in the Elk River and the West Hickory creek of the Cumberland river drainage. living up to only 3 years the life span of F. julisia is very short. In many cases the majority of the population does not even reach that age. Most adult males are eaten by birds because of their bright coloration during breeding season. Current management plans are in place for the improvement of the species such as captive breeding and reintroduction, and also private management of streams and land. Yet, more can be done to aid them in their survival efforts. Buffer zones around streams can be created to promote the health of the stream and close observation of the introduced populations needs to be a priority. With only three small original populations left in the wild it is important that species survive in captivity, but more so in its natural environment.",nature,7

"James Grieve is an old variety of apple. It gets its name from its breeder, James Grieve, who raised the apple from pollination of a Pott's Seedling or a Cox's Orange Pippin apple in Edinburgh, Scotland some time before 1893. This is a savoury, juicy apple with strong acidity at first, which then mellows as the fruit matures during September, but the flesh softens soon thereafter. When picked early, it makes a sweet and delicate stewed apple, but then can be used as a dessert apple. James Grieve apples used to be grown all over Europe and were delivered to the city markets via train or horse-and-cart, but because they bruised easily they had to be carefully packed in laundry-type wicker baskets filled with straw. The fruit cannot sustain modern supermarket handling, and so they are now only grown in gardens and for direct sale to consumers. Nonetheless, James Grieve is considered a good apple because it is exceptionally tasty, it produces fruit every year, it is disease-resistant, and it is a good pollenizer for other apples. It may drop early in warm weather. It is also a good apple for making apple juice.",nature,7

The team was selected by the club's football committee and coached by a trainer, but day-to-day affairs were overseen by club secretary Joseph Wostinholm. The club saw a large influx of players during the season as it continued to bolster its numbers with amateurs loaned or signed from other teams in the local area, a policy that resulted in an unsettled side, indifferent league results, and a mid-table finish. United (nicknamed the Blades) entered the FA Cup once more but were lucky to reach the first round proper, losing to Burton Swifts during qualifying only to see the Staffordshire club disqualified.

This set is based on their recent performance in Rio de Janeiro.

The first disc is older, classic electronic music whereas the second disc is more recent, forward-facing music.

They also happened to be some of our personal favourites as DJs too, so it was inevitable that we’d have to give it a go eventually. When they finally agreed to do it, there was nowhere in the world they could possibly do the mix from other than Brazil. The duo have a massive following out there, playing regularly to wild support. Layo’s wife is from there too, so the connection runs deep.

"Duets: An American Classic is an album by Tony Bennett, released in 2006. The album was released in conjunction with Bennett's 80th birthday the previous month. The songs selected were mostly ones that Bennett had played a major role in introducing into the Great American Songbook.

"El Conquistadors is the third official album of Serbian industrial group dreDDup. It was first released in 2009 for the Belgrade record label Insurrection Records. This was the third album that had a complete story behind it. Like the first and second release talked about the past and the future (Mr Borndeads Feast and Future Porn Machine), this album experimented with the dark present tense of mankind. Taking us to the boundaries of the human being and the terrorizing truth that lurks in the shadow of hostile envirement all around. The title is purposely misspelled. The artwork was created entirely by the artist Danica Bicanic and it presented the visual art of dreDDup music. This album also concluded some guest musicians such as DJ Shark Zowie & Briggite. The complete production and studio mastering and mixing was done by miKKa. Album was digitally remastered and re-released for Beast of Prey Records from Poland in May 2010. here is the album manifest taken from dreDDup website: \""Get ready for blood, tears and sperm. This album talks about the present tense and the mankind, the boundaries of ones desires, dreams and mistakes. This is our statement to this rusted world, to these wasted dreams and plastic reality with real life and unreal people. We're sick of mediocrity in their bodies who walk empty streets without any real purpose. This album talks about them, about their sorrow, mistakes and inner demons. Without them we do not exist and without us they are nothing. This is about something real. It's about this fallen mankind. This world has become occupied, surrounded and unhealthy. We do not agree with this worlds systems of values. This is world without values, without inner boundaries that confront served mediocrity. We're so fucking sick of it all, and want to live in some better place, and really feel our childhood energy. So we named our album 'El Conquistadors' (proper Spanish title would be 'El Conquistador') but we want for those smart-ass motherfucking self-masturbating people to say that we're wrong, to say that they know better and to hear from their empty minds what do we need to do to live happy mediocrity life. And we're not even going to ask you to listen to this album, no - if you see it just run away from it, hate it, laugh at it, be the one of El Conquistadors who crush worlds without trying to feel them. Be the other one inside you, get stupid, lazy and un-civilized. But be warned - it will be too late to come to your senses in the end.....\""",music,6
"\""Go\"", written and composed by Julie Forsyth, who was a member of the Pop Group Guys 'n' Dolls and is the daughter of English entertainer Bruce Forsyth, was the United Kingdom's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1988, performed by Scott Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald won the right to perform at Dublin by winning the UK national final, A Song for Europe, where he was the eighth singer to perform. Fitzgerald was also the first singer to be chosen to represent the United Kingdom via a national telephone vote. In Dublin, the song was performed fourth on the night, after Finland's Boulevard with \""Nauravat silmät muistetaan\"", and before Turkey's Mazhar-Fuat-Özkan with \""Sufi.\"" At the end of judging that evening, \""Go\"" took the second-place slot with 136 points. Turkey, Belgium and Italy awarded their 12-point designations to the UK that evening. In one of the closest voting rounds up to that time, the UK lost the competition by one point to Switzerland's representative, Canadian singer Celine Dion, with her song \""Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi.\"" According to author and contest historian John Kennedy O'Connor, this was the closest contest yet, with the winning margin being just 0.73%. The strong showing in the 1988 contest was an indicator of things to come for the United Kingdom, as it would become the first of eleven straight Top Ten placings in the Contest, and the first of four second-place finishes in the next six years. In a departure from the past two years, an easy listening ballad was on offer this year, telling the story of two former lovers meeting by chance. Fitzgerald, in the role of the lovesick man, relates the sad story; his former lover had left him years before for another man, and now that she has returned, so has all the sorrow he felt.

"Boonoonoonoos is the fifth studio album by Boney M. It was released in September 1981. Despite producer Frank Farian having announced by the end of 1979 that Boney M. were to take a break, recording sessions for a new album began in the spring of 1980, and the title \""Boonoonoonoos\"" (a Caribbean word for \""Happiness\"") already appeared as one of the first completed tracks, a cover of Larry Dillon's ska-title \""Train to Skaville\"" which was intertwined with new rap parts \""That's Boonoonoonoos\"". Two of the new recordings, \""I See A Boat On The River\"" and \""My Friend Jack\"" were issued to promote The Magic of Boney M. - 20 Golden Hits in May 1980. Farian invited the singers Liz Mitchell and Marcia Barrett and his crew of musicians to Nice in the summer of 1980 where several new songs were recorded. A new double A-side single \""Children Of Paradise\""/\""Gadda-Da-Vida\"" was released in September, announcing the as yet untitled new album to be released in November '80. The single reached number 11 in Germany, but in the UK their popularity was now quickly slipping. When released in February 1981, the single peaked at a disappointing #66. In the meantime, Farian had decided to revise the whole album. While new pressings of \""Children Of Paradise\"" now promoted \""The Magic Of Boney M.\"" on the back cover, the band instead issued another single in December, a cover version of \""Felicidad (Margherita)\"" backed with \""Strange\"". \""Felicidad\"", originally recorded by Italian band Massara as \""Margherita (Love In The Sun)\"" in 1979, managed to get Boney M. into the German Top 10 again (#6, 27 weeks) and it became a sizeable hit in most of Europe as well. The single, however, wasn't released by Atlantic Records UK, nor was it released in Spain or Portugal where Massara's original version had been a huge hit two years earlier. In the Netherlands, the single was released with \""Strange\"" as the A-side. At the same time, singer Marcia Barrett issued the solo single \""You\"" / \""I'm Lonely\"", produced by John Edmed, and written by Kelvin James. Released in Germany in December 1980, and in the UK two months later, the single failed to chart in either of the countries. Another song from the same sessions, \""Breakaway\"", ended up on Boonoonoonoos as a Boney M. track with Frank Farian doing the lead vocal. New recording sessions took place in the spring of 1981. The band flew to Jamaica in May 1981 to record a TV special, perform live in concert with Rita Marley, shoot photos for the album cover, and one of the final songs \""Silly Confusion\"" was recorded in Bob Marley's Tuff Gong studios in Kingston. Boonoonoonoos – originally intended to be released as a double-album – was subsequently trimmed to a one disc, thirteen track release. A limited edition double album was however issued in Germany, France and the UK, containing slightly longer versions of certain songs, but with the same number of tracks.",music,6

"TONY! The Blair Musical is a satirical comedy musical written in 2007 by Chris Bush, director of the White Rose Theatre, with music composed by Ian McCluskey. TONY! follows the premiership of former British prime minister Tony Blair from his landslide election in 1997 to his resignation ten years later. It is told to the audience by Blair himself, in the form of an interplay of spotlit monologues and musical flashbacks to various moments in the former prime minister's career. The musical focuses primarily on Blair's relationships with the key characters in his life, rather than the politics, including his Chancellor and successor as Prime Minister Gordon Brown and wife Cherie Booth. It is a musically eclectic production, featuring rock pieces, power ballads and a barbershop quartet of former Tory leaders. Performed at York's Theatre Royal, the Edinburgh Fringe and the Pleasance Theatre, Islington, TONY! has been described by the BBC as \""sharp, engaging and original,\"" and as \""a shining example of honest comedy writing.\"" It has also been criticized for crude caricatures and cheap one-liners.

It is regarded as one of the prominent achievements of Bulgarian National Revival engineering and architecture. The bridge was constructed between 1865 and 1867 by Bulgarian architect and master builder Kolyu Ficheto on the order of Turkish statesman Midhat Pasha. While other architects were willing to build it for 2 to 3 million liras, Kolyu Ficheto was willing to build it for 700 thousand. When asked to confirm this sum, he replied that Midhat Pasha could take his head if he didn't succeed doing it for this sum. It is 276 m long and 6 m wide, has 14 arches each with a clearance of 12 m and decorated with relief images of animals. Constructed from local limestone and limestone plaster, it is supported by 13 props with cutwaters. The Belenski most suffered from a flood in 1897, as 8 vaults of the central part (about 130 m) were destroyed. It was reconstructed between 1922 and 1923 with reinforced concrete props and arches, but its initial appearance was altered.

"Maryland Route 404 (MD 404) is a major highway on Maryland's Eastern Shore in the United States. It runs 24.61 miles (39.61 km) from MD 662 in Wye Mills on the border of Queen Anne's and Talbot counties, southeast to the Delaware state line in Caroline County, where the road continues as Delaware Route 404 (DE 404) to Nassau (near Rehoboth Beach). The Maryland and Delaware state highways together cross the width of the Delmarva Peninsula and serve to connect the cities west of the Chesapeake Bay by way of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and U.S. Route 50 (US 50) with the Delaware Beaches. Along the way, MD 404 passes through mostly farmland and woodland as well as the towns of Queen Anne, Hillsboro, and Denton. The road is a two-lane undivided highway for most of its length with the exception of the bypass around Denton and a section near Hillsboro, which is a four-lane divided highway. MD 404 was designated by 1933 to run from Matapeake (where the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis), east along present-day MD 8, US 50, and MD 662 to Wye Mills, where it followed its current routing to the Delaware border. By 1946, the route’s western terminus was moved to MD 2 north of Annapolis, where it headed east across the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point-Matapeake ferry. The western terminus was cut back to Wye Mills in 1949, having been replaced with US 50 west of there. The route was realigned to bypass Queen Anne and Hillsboro in 1960 and Denton in 1987. Since MD 404 is the main route for travelers between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware Beaches, the road has a high accident rate. To improve on this situation, the Maryland State Highway Administration is planning to widen the two-lane portions of the route into a four-lane divided highway.

"The boulevard de l'Hôpital is a tree-lined boulevard of the 13th arrondissement of Paris, which also briefly borders on the 5th arrondissement. It runs a distance of 1,395 meters, from the Place Valhubert at the pont d'Austerlitz, by the gare d'Austerlitz, rising in a gentle slope towards its end at the place d'Italie - the town hall of the arrondissement being located at their intersection. Along the way, it serves the Jardin des Plantes and the Hôpital de la Pitié-Salpêtrière from which it derives its name. In front of the hospital stands a statue of doctor Philippe Pinel. The boulevard is an important traffic axis. Bordered by public and teaching establishments such as the general police station of the arrondissement, it has relatively little commercial and leisure activity excepting the shops and restaurants close to the gare d'Austerlitz. The boulevard is also home to the Arts et Métiers ParisTech main campus. This engineering graduate school built its facilities in 1910, at this time it was called ENSAM. Nowadays, more than 950 graduate students are attending courses in fields such as industrial or mechanical engineering.

"Lawrence Hargrave Drive is a scenic coastal road and popular tourist drive connecting the northernmost suburbs of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia to both Wollongong and Sydney. It was originally constructed in the 1870s. The road begins at the Old Princes Highway, Helensburgh (Southern Freeway exit) and passes through Stanwell Tops to descend the steep Illawarra Escarpment at Bald Hill, the site of a spectacular lookout and hang gliding area. The road then passes south through Stanwell Park and Coalcliff to cross the renowned Sea Cliff Bridge. The Sea Cliff Bridge construction was completed in December 2005, replacing the former cliff-hugging route which was prone to rockfalls and consequent closures. Remnants of the former road can still be seen to this day, including some of the guard rail and most of the road section which is now overgrown with trees and ridden with boulders and rocks that have fallen freely since the roads closure, essentially acting as a ditch.The road then winds its way through the coastal villages of Clifton, Scarborough, Wombarra, Coledale, Austinmer and finally Thirroul where it meets the Princes Highway at the bottom of Bulli Pass. The road was formerly known as Lower Coast Road until 1947 when it was renamed after Lawrence Hargrave, an Australian aviation pioneer and explorer who had a house at Stanwell Park and flew his devices from Bald Hill.",transportation,10

"Interstate 80 (I-80) is a major Interstate Highway in the United States, running from the New York City Metropolitan Area westward to San Francisco, California. The New Jersey Department of Transportation also identifies I-80 as the Christopher Columbus Highway. I-80 in New Jersey runs 68.54 miles (110.30 km) from the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge over the Delaware River at the Delaware Water Gap to its eastern terminus at I-95 in Teaneck, Bergen County. I-95 continues from the end of I-80 to the George Washington Bridge for access to New York City; access is also provided via the I-280 spur towards the Holland Tunnel and US 46 to Route 3, or I-95, towards the Lincoln Tunnel. Throughout New Jersey, I-80 runs parallel to US 46. The highway heads through rural areas of Warren and Sussex counties before heading into more suburban surroundings in Morris County. As the road continues into Passaic and Bergen counties, it heads into more urban areas. A freeway along the I-80 corridor had been planned in 1936 and again in 1955 to provide relief along US 46 between the George Washington Bridge and the Delaware Water Gap. With the establishment of the Interstate Highway System, this planned freeway, which had been identified in some planning documents as the Bergen-Passaic Expressway, would be incorporated into I-80. The freeway was built across New Jersey in various stages from the 1960s to 1973. The westernmost four miles in New Jersey was originally a rerouting of US 611 when built; that route was later realigned back into Pennsylvania. In the 1990s, high-occupancy vehicle lanes had existed on a part of I-80 in Morris County but were opened to regular traffic due to underuse. The Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge and its approach is planned to be widened from four to six lanes, with construction beginning in 2015.",transportation,10

"Tinkers Creek Aqueduct is an aqueduct that was constructed to bridge the Ohio and Erie Canal over Tinkers Creek near its confluence with the Cuyahoga River in Valley View, Ohio. It is a relatively rare surviving example of an Ohio and Erie Canal aqueduct. It was originally constructed in 1825-1827 by, and re-built due to flood damage in 1845 and 1905. Tinkers Creek Aqueduct was included in a National Historic Landmark district established in 1966, and it was separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The original Tinkers Creek Aqueduct was a wood plank, steel truss, and Ashlar-sandstone structure constructed in 1827, south of the present aqueduct's location. Cuyahoga River and Tinkers Creek flooding caused continual damage to the original aqueduct, so successive structures were built in 1845 and 1905 in the present location. Today, Tinkers Creek Aqueduct is the only aqueduct which remains of the four original aqueducts in the Cuyahoga Valley. Of Furnace Run Aqueduct, Mill Creek Aqueduct, Peninsula Aqueduct, and (?

"The Loren Bridge (Russian: Мост через реку Лорен) is a unique bridge that crosses the Loren River, and is located in Chukotsky District, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia. The two-way bridge is 113 metres long and six metres wide and was built to connect the roads between the towns of Lavrentiya and Lorino. Construction required the structure to span a river delta, a notable engineering feat in Russia's Far East. The first bridge crossing the Loren was constructed in the 1990s, but the difficult Arctic conditions quickly led to the bridge falling into disrepair. The old bridge was deemed unfit for use and is in the process of dismantlement in favor of the new Loren Bridge.

"The N26 road is a national primary road in northeast County Mayo in Ireland connecting the N5 road at Swinford with the N58 at Foxford and then on to the N59 road at Ballina. The road also meets six regional roads along its route, and it is 29.8 kilometres (18.5 mi) long (map). The government legislation that defines the N26, the S.I. No. 53/2012 — Roads Act 1993 (Classification of National Roads) Order 2012, provides the following official description: N26: Swinford — Ballina, County MayoBetween its junction with N5 at Kilbride in the county of Mayo and its junction with N59 at Lord Edward Street in the town of Ballina via Back Street and Main Street at Swinford; Clongullane Bridge, Callow; Chapel Road and Bridge Street at Foxford; Bellass, Drumrevagh, Carrowntreila and Rahans in the county of Mayo: Rahans Bridge at the boundary between the county of Mayo and the town of Ballina; Foxford Road, Station Road and Kevin Barry Street in the town of Ballina. This route was previously a national secondary road known as the N57 (leaving the N57 as a defunct route allocation). The route is Mayo's second busiest road after the N5 with almost 10,000 vehicles daily using the route between Ballina and Foxford. The route diverges from the N5 near Swinford and passes through that town. It runs northwest to Foxford where the road meets the N58 (which runs south back to the N5). From here the route turns north to Ballina. At Ballina the road meets the N59 which runs east-west through the town. The section between Foxford and Swinford is of very sub-standard quality and has an extremely narrow bridge over the River Moy at Callow, where two large vehicles cannot pass at the same time. The dangerous bridge is located on a double bend and interrupts the flow of traffic hugely. The N26 is the first \""extra\"" allocation of a national primary route other than the original 25. There are now primary routes up to N33. The physical upgrading, or modernisation, of the road has been in the planning stages for over 10 years.

"Elgin Bridge is a 3695 ft long important railway bridge across the Ghaghra River located in Barabanki district. The bridge falls on the Barabanki-Gonda section of the North Eastern Railway zone of Indian Railways. The bridge is about 73 km from Lucknow and stands at periodically changing confluence of two rivers i.e. Sharda River and Ghaghara River. The bridge was built on dry land and then the river was trained under it. The bridge was completed in 1896 and opened on 18 December 1896 with the opening of Jarwal Road - Behramghat section of the Bengal and North Western Railway. The bridge is named after Lord Elgin, Governor-General of India (21 March 1862 – 20 November 1863). Before construction of Elging Bridge and opening of railways between Gonda and Barabanki most of the trade was done by the river route, once the bridge was constructed the river trade decreased greatly. The bridge is an important point of experiment, research and monitoring for irrigation and flood related activities. There is a flood water level recording and forecasting station at the Elgin Bridge which records rise and fall in the Ghaghra River. Tehsil Ram Sanehi Ghat is threatened as soon as water crosses 347 ft mark at the Elgin Bridge.",transportation,10

"The Cameron Suspension Bridge crosses the Little Colorado River at Cameron, Arizona, USA. The bridge formerly carried U.S. Route 89, but was replaced by a newer deck truss bridge in 1959. Built in 1911, it has an overall length of 680 feet (210 m) and a main span of 660 feet (200 m). The bridge was built by the Midland Bridge Company of Kansas City for the Office of Indian Affairs and the Indian Irrigation Service. W. H. Code of the Midland Bridge Company was the designer. The suspension design was chosen to address the steep-walled canyon at the crossing, which required a single span with no temporary falsework. When built, the Cameron bridge was the longest suspension span west of the Mississippi River. The bridge towers rest on the rim of the canyon, with concrete deadmen anchoring the suspension cables some way back from the towers. The deck is stiffened by a Pratt through-truss, with a 14-foot (4.3 m) wide roadway. The bridge was built to improve access to the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Indian Reservation. Named for U.S. Senator Ralph H. Cameron, it was an important link for the construction of the Navajo Bridge on US 89 across the Colorado River in 1929. The town of Cameron grew up around the crossing, which in addition to opening up the Native American lands to the north, also provided a northern gateway to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon when the Navajo Bridge opened. The bridge was damaged by an overload of sheep in 1937, when it almost collapsed. The damage was repaired and the bridge served highway traffic until 1959. It was sold to the Four Corners Pipeline Company when the new bridge opened, and carries a natural gas pipeline. It is the oldest suspension bridge in Arizona, and one of only two of that type in the state. The Cameron Suspension bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 5, 1986.",transportation,10

"The Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2, also known as LRT Line 2, LRT-2, or Megatren, is a rapid transit line in Metro Manila in the Philippines, generally running in an east-west direction along the Radial Road 6 and a portion of the Circumferential Road 1. Although operated by the Light Rail Transit Authority, resulting in its being called \""LRT-2\"", it is actually a heavy rail, rapid transit system owing to its use of electric multiple units instead of the light rail vehicles used in earlier lines and is the only line utilizing such type of system in the country. Envisioned in the 1970s as part of the Metropolitan Manila Strategic Mass Rail Transit Development Plan, the eleven-station, 13.8-kilometer (8.6 mi) line was the third rapid transit line to be built in Metro Manila when it started operations in 2003. It is operated by the Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA), a government-owned and controlled corporation under the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) under an official development assistance scheme. Serving close to 200,000 passengers daily, LRT-2 is the least busy among Metro Manila's three rapid transit lines, and was built with standards such as barrier-free access and the use of magnetic card tickets to facilitate passenger access in mind. Total ridership however is significantly below the line's built maximum capacity, with various solutions being proposed or implemented to increase ridership in addition to the planned extensions to the line. However, the short-term solutions have had a minimal effect on ridership, and experts have insisted that the extensions be built immediately, despite pronouncements that the system is steadily increasing ridership each year. LRT-2 is integrated with the public transit system in Metro Manila, and passengers also take various forms of road-based public transport, such as buses and jeepneys, to and from a station to reach their intended destination. Although the line aimed to reduce traffic congestion and travel times along R-6 and portions of C-1, the transportation system has only been partially successful due to the rising number of motor vehicles and rapid urbanization. Expanding the network's revenue line to accommodate more passengers is set on tackling this problem.",transportation,10

"The Darlington's Bridge at Delaware Station was a highway bridge over the Delaware River in the community of Delaware, New Jersey (known locally as Delaware Station). Formerly a railroad bridge constructed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1871 to replace an earlier 1855 timber span, the bridge was sold off when the new one upstream was constructed. Henry V. Darlington, an Episcopal minister in Delaware and nearby Belvidere offered to buy the second-hand bridge for $5,000 (1914 USD, equal to $118,123 today). Darlington converted it into a highway bridge, using two fired members of the nearby Meyer's Ferry to be toll collectors. The bridge prospered, becoming a part of State Highway Route 6 in 1927 and U.S. Route 46 in 1936. In 1932, during the massive state takeover of bridges by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, Darlington refused offers, bargaining his way up to $275,000 (1932 USD, equal to $4,769,573 today) before accepting the sale. This amount was a far cry from the nearby Belvidere-Riverton and Portland-Columbia Covered Bridge, which were accepted for $60,000 (equal to $1,040,634 today) and $50,000 (equal to $867,195 today) respectively. On that moment, tolls along the bridge and Route 6 were eliminated. The bridge prospered toll-free for another 21 years, until the construction of the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge upstream at Columbia. Although Reverend Darlington was still alive to see all this transpire, the Commission ceased operations on the Darlington Bridge on April 3, 1954, and the bridge was immediately demolished.",transportation,10

"The Gasworks Bridge, also known as the Old Gasworks Bridge, is an iron bridge across the River Thames at Oxford in England. It is a pedestrian bridge linking St Ebbes to the Grandpont nature reserve. It crosses the river on the reach between Iffley Lock and Osney Lock. The bridge was constructed by the Oxford & District Gas Company in 1886 for a short railway branch line to carry coal to the gas works from the main Cherwell Valley Line at a junction just south of Osney Rail Bridge. The bridge was built by assembling sections on the south bank of the river and floating them into position. The gas works was demolished in 1960; no evidence of the railway line is visible on the footbridge. Since the demolition of the gas works, other names have been used for the bridge. For a few years after the closure of the railway it appears to have been crossed by a private road, and the Environment Agency refers to the bridge simply as \""Road Bridge\"", although no road now crosses it. The bridge is now usually referred to by its old name. It has occasionally been referred to as Osney Footbridge, although the bridge is some distance from Osney, and that name is also used for a different bridge.",transportation,10

"Southport Reporter is an online newspaper started by Patrick Trollope. It is not only seen as a newspaper but also as the UK's first online-only regional newspaper. It is based in Southport on Merseyside, and was quickly recognised by the National Union of Journalists as well as other media groups, authorities and organizations as a newspaper. This recognition was due to the fact it was only run by certificated professional journalists (often the journalist held NUJ or IFJ ID/certification). As a result they had to follow and run under the rules of the UK Press Complaints Commission's Code of Practice and the NUJ Code of Conduct.

"Acta Mathematica is a peer-reviewed scientific journal covering research in all fields of mathematics. The journal was established by Gösta Mittag-Leffler in 1882 and is published by Institut Mittag-Leffler, a research institute for mathematics belonging to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Since 2006, the journal has been printed and distributed by Springer Science+Business Media. According to Cédric Villani, this journal is \""considered by many to be the most prestigious of all mathematical research journals\"". Villani writes that the journal's \""most famous episode\"" concerns Henri Poincaré, who won a prize offered in 1887 by Oscar II of Sweden for the best mathematical work concerning the stability of the Solar System by purporting to prove the stability of a special case of the three-body problem. The prize paper was to be published in Acta Mathematica, but after the issue containing the paper was printed, Poincaré found an error that invalidated his proof. He paid more than the prize money to destroy the print run and reprint the issue without his paper, and instead published a corrected paper a year later in the same journal that demonstrated that the system could be unstable. This paper later became one of the foundational works of chaos theory.",history,5
"Animerica was a quarterly digest published by Viz Media. It initially started as a monthly magazine featuring reviews of anime and manga titles, as well as related works. After a preview issue was released in November 1992, the magazine's first issue was released in February 1993 with a March 1993 cover date. The magazine originally featured articles and reviews on manga, anime, and related media, as well as manga preview chapters.

One is advertising-oriented and created specially for distribution at anime and manga conventions while the other is more general in scope and with a version each for distribution through Waldenbooks and Borders stores. A similar version was later added for Best Buy stores. All three versions have fewer and briefer articles and a lower page count. Animerica was one of the first professional anime and manga magazines released in the United States, and one of the most popular in the 1990s. In 2004, it had a circulation of 45,000 readers, but low sales and high competition from Newtype USA resulted in the essential cancellation of the original magazine and its reformatting as a free digest. 100 copies of the first issue of the free digest were sent to 1,000 Waldenbooks and Border stores.",history,5

"The Rafu Shimpo (羅府新報 Rafu Shinpō) is a Japanese-English language newspaper based in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, California. The paper began in 1903 as a one-page, mimeographed Japanese-language newspaper produced by Rippo Iijima, Masaharu Yamaguchi, and Seijiro Shibuya. H. T. Komai became publisher in 1922, beginning a family dynasty. He was succeeded by son Akira and grandson Michael. The name of the newspaper essentially translates as \""Los Angeles area newspaper\"" (\""ra\"" abbreviated from \""rashogiri\"", said to be a Chinese name for Los Angeles, \""fu\"" meaning \""prefecture\"", and \""shinpo\"", a term for newspaper). Togo Tanaka, the editor of the paper's English language section, appealed unsuccessfully to the United States government to allow the paper to continue printing in the event of war with Japan, and oversaw the paper's last edition before he was sent to the Manzanar internment camp. The paper ceased publication in 1942 due to the Japanese American Internment. It was revived in 1946, due to Akira Komai's foresight and the loyalty of his employees. Komai had arranged for the paper's rent to be paid during the war and hid the Japanese type under the floorboards. In March 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported that The Rafu Shimpo was losing circulation and money, and was the target of community drives hoping to save the newspaper from going out of business.

"Morgunblaðið (Icelandic pronunciation: [ˈmɔrkʏnˌplaðɪð], The Morning Paper) is a newspaper published in Iceland, founded by Vilhjálmur Finsen and Olaf Björnsson, brother of the first president. The first issue, only eight pages long, was published on 2 November 1913. In 1919, the corporation Árvakur bought out the company. The paper had a close relationship with the conservative Independence Party (Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn), especially during the Cold War, and its editors or their parliamentary reporters routinely sat in on meetings of the parliamentary party until 1983 when Geir Hallgrímsson, Chairman of the Board of Árvakur and also the Chairman of the Independence Party, decided that this relationship was in the best interests of neither the party nor the newspaper. Although its connection with the Independence Party is not as direct as in previous decades, the newspaper is sometimes criticised for leaning too much towards the party, especially at election times. Although the paper shares the mainstream conservative values of the Independence Party, it has also shown its independence on some key issues, especially in the debate on fishing rights distribution. Lately the paper has made a point of recruiting left-leaning journalists and has echoed feminist policies on the op-ed pages. Morgunblaðið is opposed to Icelandic membership of the European Union. Since its initial publication, Morgunblaðið was until 2003 not published on Mondays. It soon established itself as the newspaper of record. It was always the number one newspaper in Iceland, and it took an absolute lead in the early 1970s and routed most of the competition, enjoying an unchallenged superiority for the next three decades. During this period, Morgunblaðið launched a number of special sections on finance, fisheries, food etc. After the rival Fréttablaðið, delivered free to homes, took the competition to a new level by starting a Monday edition, Morgunblaðið responded to the challenge and has since 2003 been published every day of the week, with 60 to 120 pages. Advertising accounts for 30% to 40% of the column space. Daily circulation hovers between 50,000 and 55,000, the bulk being paid subscriptions. Circulation is mostly focused on the southwestern part of the country, especially the capital Reykjavík and nearby settlements. As a result of the Icelandic financial crisis, 24 stundir, published by Morgunblaðið, ceased publication on 10 October 2008, resulting in 20 jobs being cut. In a controversial decision, the owners of the paper decided in September 2009 to appoint Davíð Oddsson, a member of the Independence Party, Iceland's longest-serving Prime Minister and former head of the Central Bank, as one of the two editors of the paper. Morgunblaðið's website, mbl.is, is the highest ranking Icelandic website with about 80% domestic visits.",history,5

The incumbent chairman is Park Jeong-jin, and the ex-chairman of the school is a Korean representative Kang Sung-Jong, of the Democratic Party of South Korea. However, due to an embezzlement scandal involving the former chairman of the school, who channeled approximately 3.6 billion Korean Won of tuition to his personal use, the school's reputation plummeted and its budget was crippled. Several teachers have also complained implicitly that they have not been compensated for their work a number of years ago. Reports say that the teacher situation in regards to pay was resolved around 2007. A sizeable portion of the parents and the students left Indianhead International School, with some headed to Korean public schools while others, to other international schools in Korea. During the academic year of 2010-11, Chairman Park Jeong-Jin, a relative of Rep. Kang Sung-Jong, declared that the school will move to Jeju Island and double the tuition fee; the Parent-Teacher Association responded with dissent both within and against the chairman and many parents have said that they will leave to other educational institutions. Although the consensus of the Parent-Teacher Association was that the school should continue to operate, many members in the PTA disagreed on the means by which the school should be restored to its normal function. Most recently, Indianhead International School declined the opportunity to continue administering the SATs as they no longer have the personnel to staff the events. Since an international school is required to replace Indianhead International School as an SAT test center, the International Christian School in Uijeongbu was assigned as the new testing center in the region. It is estimated that, due to lack of families contributing their tuition fees, the Indianhead International School will cease to function after the graduating class of 2012 or 2013.",education,2

In one strip he turned himself into a dodo, tricking his teacher into believing that that bird was not extinct; in another, he became a grotesque mole-like creature, burrowing under a smoke chimney and causing it to collapse. Reid continued drawing Faceache until his death in early 1987. Frank McDiarmid took over from then on, until the strip ended in the issue dated 1 October 1988. An adult Faceache appears in the 2005 comic Albion, as one of a number of comic book characters who have been imprisoned by the British government. In Albion Faceache's real name is said to be \""Frederick\"". The term \""faceache\"" was commonly used in England from the 1950s onwards to mean \""miserable-looking person\"".",games,4

Photometric observations of this asteroid during 1994 were used to build a light curve showing a rotation period of 37.56 ± 0.05 hours with a brightness variation of 0.20 ± 0.03 magnitude. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 59.3 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.073, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a somewhat larger diameter of 66.9 kilometers, as the lower a body's albedo (reflectivity), the larger its diameter, at a constant absolute magnitude (brightness).",astrology-astronomy,1
"Vinasat-2 is the second Vietnamese satellite to be placed in orbit. It was launched at 5.13am on May 16 at the European Spaceport in Kourou in French Guiana in South America and by 5.48 am it entered orbit. VINASAT is the national satellite program of Vietnam. The project aims to bring independence in satellite communications for Vietnam, besides other benefits such as enhancing national security, opening new economic opportunities, etc. Vietnam hopes for some economic benefits from the telecommunications links that the satellite will provide. It will provide communication for fishermen at sea, deliver weather forecasts and ensure defence security.The satellite costs about US$280 million and weighing 3,000 kg, was constructed by US-based Lockheed Martin. It will be able to provide capacity equal to 13,000 channels of telephone/internet/data communications or 150 Television channels; greater number of sensor responses; and higher bandwidth capacity.

"789 Lena, provisional designation 1914 UU, is an asteroid from the middle region of the asteroid belt, approximately 24 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 24 June 1914, by Soviet–Russian astronomer Grigory Neujmin at Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. The X-type asteroid is also classified as a M-type by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.3–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 5 months (1,608 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.15 and an inclination of 11° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. Although its orbital elements resemble those of the asteroids in the Eunomia family, true members of this family have a S-type composition, so it is almost certainly an unrelated interloper. The first used observation was made much later at the U.S Yerkes Observatory in 1935, reducing the asteroid's observation arc by 21 years with respect to its discovery date. In 1993, a rotational light-curve which was later proven incorrect, was obtained from photometric observations at the Félix Aguilar Observatory, Argentina. It gave an unusual light-curve, indicating a very irregular shape and/or a relatively long rotation period of 22 hours with an exceptionally high amplitude of 1.5 in magnitude (U=0). In August and September 2007, two new light-curves were obtained by Italian astronomer Silvano Casulli and by members at the U.S.Oakley Observatory, and gave a period of 5.848±0.001 and 5.85±0.05 hours, with a brightness variation of 0.50 and of 0.40 in magnitude, respectively (U=3/2+). According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of the WISE telescope, the asteroid has an albedo of 0.19 and 0.14, with a diameter of 20.6 and 23.9 kilometers, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a much lower albedo of 0.10 and calculates a diameter of 24.2 kilometer, as the lower the albedo (reflectivety), the larger a body's diameter, at a constant absolute magnitude (brightness). The minor planet was named in honor of Elena (\""Lena\"") Petrovna Neujmina (1860–1942), mother of the discovering astronomer.",astrology-astronomy,1

"4391 Balodis, provisional designation 1977 QW2, is a dark and rare Erigone asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 8 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Soviet–Russian astronomer Nikolai Chernykh at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj, on the Crimean peninsula, on 21 August 1977. The C-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.9 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,348 days). Based on its orbital elements, the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) classifies the asteroid as a member of the Erigone family, which is named after its largest member and namesake, 163 Erigone, also a dark body of carbonaceous composition. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic. According to observations by NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures 3.4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an exceptionally high albedo of 0.40. However, the CALL assumes a much lower albedo of 0.06, a typical value for a carbonaceous asteroid, and calculates a diameter of 8.4 kilometers, as the lower the albedo (reflectivity) the larger the body's diameter at a constant absolute magnitude (brightness). A rotational light-curve was obtained by Italian astronomer Albino Carbognani from photometric observations taken in July 2010, at the Astronomical Observatory of the Autonomous Region of the Aosta Valley (OAVdA) in Italy. It showed rotation period of 3.448±0.001 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.29 in magnitude (U=2). The minor planet was named after Latvian cosmic geodesist Jānis Balodis, head of the Astronomical Observatory at University of Latvia. His research includes astrometry, observations of artificial satellites using laser, as well as computational methods for astrometric interpretations of photographic plates. The Crimean minor planet service has used his algorithms for a long time. (The honored astronomer should not to be confused with Soviet army General Jānis Balodis.)

"Astra 1B was the second of the Astra communications satellites launched and operated by SES (Société Européenne des Satellites). It was bought during its construction from GE Americom, and was launched to add extra capacity to the satellite television services from 19.2° east, serving Germany, the UK and Republic of Ireland. It was believed to have been launched in a faulty condition, and suffered a thruster failure early in its life, causing minor drift, meaning that it became permanently difficult to obtain a steady lock on the satellite. This was most notable on analogue transmissions where the picture would move from clear to carrying sparklies and back again. Along with Astra 1C, Astra 1B was to be replaced in 2002 with Astra 1K, which failed to launch successfully, and as a result it continued to serve a longer life than expected, only falling from use when digital television on Astra 2A removed the majority of UK and Ireland targeted channels from 19.2° east. From 2005, SES claimed that the satellite was in use for VSAT services, however no transponders were powered, and the satellite drifted to around 19.5° east. One transponder was reactivated in October 2005, but was carrying only colour bars. On June 16, 2006 SES confirmed that Astra 1B would be decommissioned and de-orbited within weeks after Astra 1KR, the satellite which would replace Astra 1B and 1C, reached the operational orbital position of 19.2° east.

"2874 Jim Young, provisional designation 1982 TH, is a stony Florian asteroid and relatively slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 7.5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 13 October 1982, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell Observatory's Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,228 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.13 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in 1954, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 28 years prior to its discovery. In January 2007, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained by U.S. astronomer Donald P. Pray at his Carbuncle Hill Observatory. It gave a very long rotation period of 131.3 hours with a brightness amplitude of approximately 0.75 in magnitude (U=2). According to two different data sets from NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures 7.0 and 7.7 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.190 and 0.226, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 – derived from 8 Flora, the family's largest member and namesake – and calculates a diameter of 7.5 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 12.8. The minor planet was named for U.S. astronomer James Young at JPL's Table Mountain Observatory near Wrightwood, California.

"Pandora (/pænˈdɔərə/ pan-DOHR-ə; Greek: Πανδώρα) is an inner satellite of Saturn. It was discovered in 1980 from photos taken by the Voyager 1 probe, and was provisionally designated S/1980 S 26. In late 1985 it was officially named after Pandora from Greek mythology. It is also designated as Saturn XVII. Pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. However, recent studies indicate that it does not play such a role, and that only Prometheus, the inner shepherd, contributes to the confinement of the narrow ring. It is more heavily cratered than nearby Prometheus, and has at least two large craters 30 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter. The majority of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on moon's surface. The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean-motion resonances with Prometheus. The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about 1,400 kilometres (870 mi). Pandora also has a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Mimas. From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Pandora is a very porous icy body. There is a lot of uncertainty in these values, however, so this remains to be confirmed.",astrology-astronomy,1

"2577 Litva, provisional designation 1975 EE3, is a Hungarian-type Mars-crosser and rare trinary asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 4 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 12 March 1975, by Soviet–Ukrainian astronomer Nikolai Chernykh at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj, on the Crimean peninsula. The E-type asteroid, classified as an EU-subtype in the Tholen taxonomy, is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.6–2.2 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (960 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.14 and is tilted by 23 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has a rotation period of 2.813 hours and an assumed, very high albedo of 0.4, which is typical for E-type asteroids of the Hungaria family. In March 2009 the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams announced the discovery of a moon orbiting the asteroid. The satellite measures about 1.4 kilometer in diameter and orbits Litva at distance of 21 kilometers, with an orbital period of 1 day, 11 hours, and 53 minutes. In 2012, a second satellite orbiting at a distance of 378 kilometers with a diameter of 1.2 kilometers was discovered, with a rotation period of 214 days. The discovery was announced in late 2013.

"1604 Tombaugh, provisional designation 1931 FH, is an asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, about 32 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by American astronomer Carl Otto Lampland at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, on March 24, 1931. The X-type asteroid is a member of the Eos family and classified as a XSCU and Xc subtype in the Tholen and SMASS taxonomy, respectively. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.3 AU once every 5 years and 3 months (1,920 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.10 and is tilted by 9 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. Its rotation has been measured several times with resulting periods between 6 and 8 hours. Observations by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, and by the Japanese satellite Akari, measured an albedo of 0.10 and 0.14, respectively. The asteroid was named after American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh (1906–1997), famous for his discovery of Pluto in 1930. The Lowell Observatory named the body on the occasion of a symposium on Pluto, held in 1980. When Tombaugh examined the photographic plates during the trans-Saturnian search program at the Lowell Observatory, he also marked over 4,000 minor planets on these plates.",astrology-astronomy,1

"1840 Hus, provisional designation 1971 UY, is a carbonaceous asteroid dwelling the outer regions of the asteroid belt. It was discovered on 26 October 1971 by Czech astronomer Luboš Kohoutek at Bergedorf Observatory in Hamburg, Germany. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.9–3.0 AU once every 5 years (1,821 days). It has a rotation period of 4.780 hours. The asteroid is calculated to measure about 27 kilometers in diameter and to have a geometric albedo of 0.06, as assumed by the Light Curve Database project (LCDB). These figures strongly deviate from observations made by the NEOWISE survey, that indicated the body to be only half the size with a higher albedo of 0.25, which would be rather unusual if it were a C-type asteroid, as assumed by the LCDB project. It is named after Czech Jan Hus (1372–1415), a fifteenth century Bohemian theologian, rector of Charles University in Prague and forerunner of the protestant reformation.

The lower limit on its mass is only slightly less than the deuterium burning threshold that some astronomers use to distinguish between planets and brown dwarfs. Depending on the inclination of its orbit, the true mass could be above this limit. The orbit of the object is located at the average distance of 1.45 astronomical units from the parent star, taking 40 months to complete one eccentric orbit.

It was discovered by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research at the U.S. Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site in Socorro, New Mexico, on 24 August 1998. The asteroid is a member of the Eunomia family, a large group of S-type asteroids and the most prominent family in the intermediate main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.2–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,598 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 12° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at the Venezuelan OAN de Llano del Hato in 1992, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 6 years prior to its discovery. A rotational light-curve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations made at the Australian Oakley Southern Sky Observatory (E09) in April 2010.

"NGC 134, also known as the Giant Squid Galaxy, is a barred spiral galaxy that resembles the Milky Way with its spiral arms loosely wrapped around a bright, bar-shaped central region. Its loosely bound spiral arms categorize it as Hubble-type Sbc. It is 60 million light years away, and part of the Sculptor constellation. The VLT image of the galaxy (shown right) reveals the following. A prominent feature of NGC 134 is its warped disc, i.e., when viewed sideways it does not appear flat. A trail of gas is stripped from the top edge of the disc. Together, these features suggest that it interacted with another galaxy, but that remains unproven. The galaxy has an abundance of ionized hydrogen regions along its spiral arms where stars are forming. These regions appear red in the picture. It also has many dark lanes of dust that occlude its complete starlight. The discovery of NGC 134 is often attributed to Sir John Herschel at the Cape of Good Hope,but he did note that it might have been the 590th object discovered by James Dunlop in his 1828 publication, six years prior to Herschel's own observations.

"2578 Saint-Exupery, provisional designation 1975 VW3, is an asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, roughly 22 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Russian female astronomer Tamara Smirnova at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj on 2 November 1975. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.3 AU once every 5 years and 2 months (1,899 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.10 and is tilted by 11 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. Little is known about the asteroids size, composition, albedo and rotation, despite having a well-observed orbit with the lowest possible uncertainty (i.e. a condition code of 0) and an observation arc that spans over a period of more than 60 years. Based on its absolute magnitude of 11.5, its diameter could be anywhere between 13 and 30 kilometers, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25. Since most asteroids in the outer main-belt are of a carbonaceous rather than of a silicaceous composition, with low albedos, typically around 0.05, the asteroid's diameter might be on the upper end of NASA's published conversion table, as the lower the reflectivity (albedo), the larger the body's diameter for a given absolute magnitude. On the other hand, based on its orbital elements such as its semi-major axis, eccentricity and inclination, the body might be a member of the Eos family, which are well known for mostly being of stony composition with a relatively high albedo. Hence, Saint-Exupery's diameter would be closer to 13 kilometers. The minor planet was named in honour of French aviator and writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (1900–1944). The name is appropriate, as Saint-Exupéry's best-known character, The Little Prince, lives on an asteroid. In the book, the little prince's asteroid also has a unique code: B612, which does not a match the minor planet's provisional designation. However, there is another asteroid called 46610 Bésixdouze, which is French for \""B-six-twelve\"" (B612 in hexadecimal notation equals 46610).",astrology-astronomy,1
"2537 Gilmore, provisional designation 1951 RL, is an Eunomia asteroid from the middle region of the asteroid belt, approximately 7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 4 September 1951, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory in southern Germany. The asteroid is a member of the Eunomia family, a large group of S-type asteroids and the most prominent family in the intermediate main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.2–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,581 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 13° with respect to the ecliptic. As no precoveries were taken, the asteroid's observation arc begins with its discovery in 1951. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 7.2 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.309, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.21 and calculates a diameter of 6.7 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.19. Two rotational light-curves for this asteroid were obtained from photometric observations at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory, California, from January to February 2014. The light-curves gave a rotation period of 4.230±0.020 and 4.2302±0.0399 hours with a brightness variation of 0.34 and 0.35 in magnitude, respectively (U=2/2).

"192 Nausikaa is a large main-belt S-type asteroid. It was discovered by Johann Palisa on February 17, 1879 at Pula, then in Austria, now in Croatia. The name derives from Nausicaä, a princess in Homer's Odyssey. This is an S-type asteroid around 86 km with an elliptical ratio of 1.51. The sidereal rotation period is 13.6217 hours. Based on the lightcurve data obtained from Nausikaa, a possible satellite was reported in 1985. However, this has not been confirmed. A shape model of Nausikaa has been constructed, also based on the lightcurve data. It indicates a roughly cut, but not very elongated body. In 1998 an occultation of a star by the asteroid was observed from the United States. In 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but the effort came up empty.

"Despina (/dᵻˈspiːnə/ di-SPEE-nə or /dᵻˈspaɪnə/ di-SPY-nə; Latin: Despœna,; Greek: Δέσποινα), also known as Neptune V, is the third closest inner satellite of Neptune. It is named after Despoina, a nymph who was a daughter of Poseidon and Demeter. Despina was discovered in late July 1989 from the images taken by the Voyager 2 probe. It was given the temporary designation S/1989 N 3. The discovery was announced (IAUC 4824) on August 2, 1989, but the text only talks of \""10 frames taken over 5 days\"", giving a discovery date of sometime before July 28. The name was given on 16 September 1991. Despina is irregularly shaped and shows no sign of any geological modification. It is likely that it is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of Neptune's original satellites, which were smashed up by perturbations from Triton soon after that moon's capture into a very eccentric initial orbit. Despina's orbit lies close to but outside of the orbit of Thalassa and just inside the Le Verrier ring. As it is also below Neptune's synchronous orbit radius, it is slowly spiralling inward due to tidal deceleration and may eventually impact Neptune's atmosphere, or break up into a planetary ring upon passing its Roche limit due to tidal stretching.",astrology-astronomy,1

"449 Hamburga is a large Main belt asteroid that was discovered by German astronomers Max Wolf and A. Schwassmann on October 31, 1899 in Heidelberg. It is classified as a C-type asteroid and is probably composed of carbonaceous material. It is named for the city of Hamburg in Germany. The name was announced in 1901 during a festival held by the Mathematical Society of Hamburg. In the 1980s and 1990s, NASA considered a spacecraft mission to the asteroid, including a tie-in with McDonald's. The mission plan called for a launch in 1995 and a flyby of Hamburga in early 1998. In August 1988 in the United States' city of Baltimore, a P. Weissman addressed the International Astronomical Union on a mission to this asteroid (449), a mission which also include a rendezvous with Comet Kopf. See Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby for more on the mission to the comet. This mission can also be compared to Rosetta, which successfully flew by two minor planets and orbited a Comet during its approach to the Sun in the early 21st century. P. Weissman later worked on the Rosetta mission It was predicted that 449 occulted the star HIP 1424 in July 2013. 449 Hamburga was identified as one of three asteroids that were likely to be a parent body for chondrites along with 304 Olga and 335 Roberta. All three asteroids were known to have low-albedo (not reflect as much light) and be close to \""meteorite producing resonances\"". Chrondrites are the most common type of meteor found on Earth, accounting for over 80% of all meteors. They are named for the tiny spherical silicate particles that are found inside them (those particles are called chondrules).",astrology-astronomy,1

"Intelsat 5 (aka IS-5, PAS-5 and Arabsat 2C) was a satellite providing television and communication services for ITSO and Inmarsat, which it was jointly commissioned by. It was manufactured by Aeronutronics. At beginning of life, it generates nearly 10 kilowatts. This version takes advantage of such advances as dual-junction gallium arsenide solar cells, new battery technology and the first commercial use of a high-efficiency xenon ion propulsion system (XIPS). PanAmSat became HSC's first customer to launch the new model, on Aug. 28, 1997, on a Russian Proton-K Blok-DM3 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. PAS-5 provides satellite services in the Americas, with access to Europe, including direct-to-home television services in Mexico. Controllers began noticing degradation of the nickel-hydrogen battery in PAS-5 earlier 1998. The effect on operations was analyzed in June 1998. During periods of peak solar eclipse, which occur twice a year, PanAmSat will be required to shut off a portion of the satellite's payload for some time. PanAmSat reportedly received a compensation of US$185 million from its insurers after the satellite was declared a \""total loss\"" because its capacity was reduced by more than 50 percent. PAS 5 was leased in May 2002 to the Arab Satellite Communications Organisation (Arabsat). The television channels it broadcasts include BBC World News, Australia Network and regular feeds of Entertainment Tonight and The Wall Street Journal Report. As of September 28, 2012, BBC World News was replaced with a static video slate advising that the service would be only available on the existing horizontally aligned lower powered Pacific beam on Intelsat 19 which is 3.94 GHz @ 27.69 MBd QPSK 3/4.

"The San Roque Dam, operated under San Roque Multipurpose Project (SRMP) is a 200-meter-tall, 1.2 kilometer long embankment dam on the Agno River. It is the largest dam in the Philippines and sixteenth largest in the world (see List of largest dams in the world). It spans the municipalities of San Manuel and San Nicolas, Pangasinan and is nearly 200 km north of Metro Manila. The dam impounds a reservoir with a surface area of about 12.8 square kilometers extending North into the municipality of Itogon, Benguet. A gated spillway protects the dam from overtopping. Each wet season, the run-off is stored for later release via water turbines to generate power and irrigate crops. Agno River is the third largest river in the Philippines with a total length of 221 kilometers and a drainage basin at the Project site of 1,225 square kilometers. The river originates in the Cordillera Mountains, initially flows from north to south, divides into several channels in the flat central plain of Luzon and meanders westerly through the provinces of Pangasinan and Tarlac before emptying into the Lingayen Gulf. San Roque Power Corporation (SRPC) financed and constructed the SRMP under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the National Power Corporation (NPC) on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis. SRPC substantially completed the SRMP at midnight, February 14, 2003, at which time its peaking power, irrigation, flood control and enhanced water quality benefits became available to the surrounding regions, which include the Northwest Luzon Economic Growth Quadrangle. In reality, all but its power benefits have been available since mid-2002 when the dam and spillway were completed. Ownership of the dam and spillway was transferred to NPC upon construction completion, as it contributed funds for the non-power components on behalf of several agencies.

"The Kambar-Ata Dam (also known as Kambar-Ata 1 or Kambaratinsk Dam) is a proposed dam on the Naryn River in central Kyrgyzstan. One of six planned to be built on the river, it will become one of the largest dams in the world at approximately 275 metres (902 ft) high and containing about 370 million cubic metres (480 million cu yd) of rock and earth. The Kambar-Ati-1 Hydro Power Plant at the base of the dam will have a capacity of around 2,000 megawatts. The project will be constructed jointly with Russia and possibly Kazakhstan as well. The dam will be created by using about 440,000 metric tonnes of explosives to blast the canyon walls, causing landslides that will block the Naryn River. This strategy will save time and money over conventional embankment building methods. The hydroelectric power plant, spillway and other associated structures will be completed separately. The first attempt to build a dam at this site was in 1986, but construction stopped due to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The project was reinstated in 2008 and will be largely funded by US$2 billion in Russian aid, promised in return for \""enhanced economic and security cooperation\"" with Russia. It is hoped that this dam and others on the Naryn will help Kyrgyzstan become a major electricity exporter, helping the country's fragile economy. Test drilling work at the dam site began in August 2013. Downstream Uzbekistan opposes the project, as the initial filling of the reservoir, and annual evaporation henceforth, would reduce the flow available in the Syr Darya for irrigation. Power generated by the dam, if exported to southern countries such as Afghanistan, could also hurt Uzbekistan's market for electricity export. According to the Uzbek government in Tashkent, Kambarata-I will also cause water shortages, as well as environmental and economic damage to Uzbekistan, and is being proposed in breach of international law. Experts interviewed by the International Crisis Group have indicated that in spite of Uzbekistan's ire regarding the project, Kambarata-I and other such projects could improve water management in the region since the dams will collect and store water that could later be released for irrigation. However, water specialists have also stated that there is a lack of political will to solve this issue.",engineering,3

The game made use of \""SoundLink\"" narration (radio drama-style streaming voice data intended to guide players through the game and give helpful hints and advice) and broadcast CD-quality music. Due to the nature of SoundLink broadcasts these games were only broadcast to players between 6:00 and 7:00PM on broadcast dates, at which times players could download the game from the Events Plaza on the BS-X application cartridge. A single rerun of the broadcasts was conducted in the same weekly format from June 3, 1996 to June 29, 1996 at 5:00 to 6:00PM. The BS-X download location for the rerun changed to Bagupotamia Temple. While the underlying gameplay itself is largely similar, new and arranged content has been added. For instance, the BS version newly featured a score counter. Furthermore, at the beginning of the game Mario is the only playable character. Later in the game, time-dependent events occur triggering, among other things, the possibility of using other characters. Another feature unique to the game is the inclusion of gold Mario statues (ten in total for each chapter) that are hidden in various locations (including Sub-Space). Collection of the statues in-game grants the player an extra life and refills the life meter. After clearing a level, the player could press \""Select\"" to see some statistics such as the number of statues, coins, cherries, and mushrooms collected, as well as display which bosses had been defeated. As a 4-volume broadcast, each week bore a different subtitle. The names of the volumes were: \n*  \""I, Super Birdo\"" (「あたしたち、スーパーキャサリンズ」 \""Atashitachi, Supa Kyasarinzu\"") \n*  \""Tryclyde's Secret Quicksand Surprise\"" (「ガブチョもびっくり流砂の秘密」 \""Gabucho Mobikkuri Ryuusa no Himitsu\"") \n*  \""Fryguy on Pack Ice\"" (「氷の海でヒーボーボー」 Koori no Umi de Hibobo) \n*  \""Wart's Trap, Look Out Mario Brothers\"" (「マムーの罠，危うしマリオブラザーズ」 Mamu no Wana, Abunau Ahi Mario Burazazu) BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge was never released outside Japan and as with all other Satellaview titles it has never been re-released as a stand-alone title. The game exists today solely in ROM-format and is traded online by Satellaview emulation enthusiasts.",technology,9
"Hard Drivin' is a driving arcade game that invites players to test drive a high-powered sports car on stunt and speed courses. The game featured one of the first 3D polygon driving environments via a simulator cabinet, rendered with a custom architecture. The force feedback, car physics simulator, game design and most game programming were done by Max Behensky. According to the in-game credit screen, Hard Drivin' was designed by two teams working concurrently in the United States and Ireland. Development began in 1988. Atari also originally intended to release the game in 1988. However, according to one of Atari's Engineer and designer, it was delayed due to the dispute from its Vice President claiming that no one would buy an arcade cabinet for $10,000 after The Last Starfighter arcade game was canceled for the same reason a few years earlier. After weeks of research, it was decided that $10,000 was an acceptable price point. Hard Drivin' was released in February 1989, when arcade driving games were largely implemented with scaled 2D sprites, such as Pole Position and OutRun, and when filled-polygon 3D graphics of any kind were rare in games. Hard Drivin' is the second commercially released arcade racing game to use 3D polygons, after Winning Run. In total, there are fifteen variations of the arcade unit. The eleven cockpit and four compact machines included various British, German and Japanese versions. Hard Drivin' sold 3,318 video game arcade cabinets. The PC games Stunt Driver and Stunts were released after Hard Drivin' and shared many elements with it.",technology,9
"Life Is Strange is an episodic graphic adventure video game developed by Dontnod Entertainment and published by Square Enix. It is available for Linux, Microsoft Windows, OS X, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One, and consists of five episodes released periodically throughout 2015. The game's plot focuses on Maxine Caulfield, a photography student who discovers that she has the ability to rewind time at any moment, leading her every choice to enact the butterfly effect. After having foreseen an approaching storm, Max must take on the responsibility to prevent it from destroying her town. The player's actions will adjust the narrative as it unfolds, and reshape it once allowed to travel back in time. Fetch quests and making environmental changes represent the forms of puzzle solving in addition to using branching choices for conversation. Development of Life Is Strange began in April 2013. It was formed with an episodic format in mind, for reasons both financial and creative. The developers conducted field research on the setting by travelling to the Pacific Northwest, and subverted known archetypes to make the characters. Player feedback influenced the adjustments made to the episodes. Story and character arc serve as the central point in the game rather than traditional graphic adventure tropes like point-and-click puzzles. The voice recording sessions took place in Los Angeles, California. During its release, Life Is Strange received generally favourable reviews commending the character development, rewind game mechanic and tackling of taboo subjects. It won the BAFTA Games Award for Best Story, the Peabody-Facebook Futures of Media Award and The Game Awards’ Games for Impact Award. Common criticisms included the slang that was used, poor lip-syncing in earlier episodes, and tonal inconsistencies in the story. It had sold one million digital copies by the end of July 2015. A digital series based on the game is being developed by Legendary Digital Studios and Square Enix.",technology,9

"Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller is a point-and-click adventure game released in 1994 by GameTek and developed by Take‑Two Interactive Software. It was available for DOS, 3DO and Macintosh. The game was notable for being one of the first CD-ROM-only games to use speech with hi-res graphics, and has been described as very similar to BloodNet, which is referenced during one of Hell's subplots. Dennis Hopper, Grace Jones, Stephanie Seymour, and Geoffrey Holder are among the actors in the game. Seymour and Holder appear in live action footage, while the rest of the cast, including Hopper and Jones, lend their voices to computer animated representations. The story is told through a variety of partial screen FMV movies in the PC version; the 3DO version uses the same movies, but runs entirely in full screen. The game is set in a dystopian 2095, and the United States of America is under the control of a fascist theocracy called the \""Hand of God\"". Unlike theocracies of the past, this government can send criminals and insurgents to hell, and has even brought a few of them back to tell their tale. In this third-person perspective, dystopian environment, players control Gideon Eshanti and Rachel Braque, two loyal agents (and lovers) of a new law enforcement agency created by the theocracy: Artificial Reality Containment, or ARC, a Cultural Revolution-like organization that enforces a ban on cybernetic technology in general and virtual reality in particular.",technology,9

The game introduces a new protagonist, \""Starkiller\"", as Darth Vader's secret apprentice, who is tasked with hunting down Jedi while killing rebels and Imperials alike in order to hide his existence from the Emperor, but soon starts to slowly redeem himself to the light side of the Force. Reviews offered fairly positive response, praising The Force Unleashed for its compelling story, robust physics, impressive art and soundtrack, while some more negative reviews cited frustrating gameplay.

"Rogue Warrior is a 2009 first-person shooter video game developed by Rebellion Developments and published by Bethesda Softworks for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game was released on November 26, 2009 in Australia, November 27 in Europe and on December 1 in North America. In Rogue Warrior, the United States has sent in Richard Marcinko, a veteran U.S. Navy SEAL, on a mission into North Korea to disrupt ballistic missile launchers. The plot is not based on the autobiography by the game's protagonist, Richard Marcinko. Marcinko is voiced by actor Mickey Rourke. First announced in 2006, Rogue Warrior was originally being developed by Zombie Studios, and was set for a 2007 release. However, the game's release was delayed after Bethesda stated that they were not satisfied with the direction Zombie Studios was taking the game. Bethesda quickly scrapped the project and brought in Rebellion Development to develop an entire new game from scratch. Rebellion, while retaining some major elements from Zombie's rendition, has taken a whole new approach to the game and its focus. Rogue Warrior was universally panned by critics, who cited it as one of the worst games of 2009 and of all time. Criticism of the game included its poor controls, multiple glitches, frequent foul language, rushed production, uninteresting gameplay, short length, very limited multiplayer and broken and exploited combat techniques.",technology,9

"L.A. Noire is a neo-noir detective action-adventure video game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It was initially released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on 17 May 2011; a Microsoft Windows port was later released on 8 November 2011. L.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed. The game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947. The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential. L.A. Noire is notable for using Depth Analysis's newly developed technology MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players must use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying. L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions had shipped nearly 5 million copies combined.",technology,9

"God of War: Ghost of Sparta is a third person action-adventure video game developed by Ready at Dawn and Santa Monica Studio, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). It was first released for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) handheld console on November 2, 2010. The game is the sixth installment in the God of War series and the fourth chronologically. Loosely based on Greek mythology, Ghost of Sparta is set in ancient Greece with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist Kratos, the God of War. Kratos is still haunted by the visions of his mortal past and decides to explore his origins. In Atlantis, he finds his mother Callisto, who claims that his brother Deimos is still alive. Kratos then journeys to the Domain of Death to rescue his brother. After initial resentment from Deimos, the brothers team up to battle the God of Death, Thanatos.

It also features many of the gameplay mechanics seen on previous Capcom fighting games, such as the use of power gauges for super moves, as well as a brand new Stand Mode, consisting of the series' signature guardian spirits that accompanies almost every character and can be summoned or dismissed at will by the player, resulting in variations in the character's move list and abilities. Original author Hirohiko Araki served as a consultant for the game and created exclusive pieces of artwork for its promotion and packaging; most notably, he developed from scratch a new character design for Midler, since Capcom was interested in using her in the game and she had been only shown from the waist-down in the original manga.",technology,9

The entire colony is run by a 7th generation supercomputer which controls the operations of all machinery on the planet. Unfortunately for the residents of Varth, Delta-7 has been possessed by the entity \""DUO\"" (Dimension Unbody Offender), thought of as an evil spirit but actually a temporal-spatial consciousness which spontaneously arose within the supercomputer. DUO has come to the conclusion that human existence is inimical to the planet, and has therefore turned the planet's defenses against its own populace. Eighty percent of the planet is laid waste by the event, and this is only the beginning of DUO's cleansing scheme. The colonists' reliance on the supercomputer has caused them to lose the ability to take care of themselves, and thus have no means of fighting back. The only hope for the colony lies in the pilots of two planes equipped with 4th generation computers which DUO cannot control—they are controlled not by machinery, but by humans.",technology,9

"Batman: Arkham Knight is a 2015 action-adventure video game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the successor to the 2013 video game Batman: Arkham Origins, and the fourth main installment in the Batman: Arkham series. Arkham Knight was released worldwide on June 23, 2015. Written by Sefton Hill, Ian Ball and Martin Lancaster, Arkham Knight is based on the franchise's long-running comic book mythos. Set one year after the events of 2011's Batman: Arkham City, the game's main storyline follows Batman as he confronts Scarecrow, who has launched an attack on Gotham City, causing a city-wide evacuation. Scarecrow, with the help of the mysterious Arkham Knight, is also able to unite Batman's greatest foes in an attempt to finally destroy Batman. The game is presented from a third-person perspective, with a primary focus on Batman's melee combat, stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets. Arkham Knight also introduces the Batmobile as a playable vehicle, which is used for transportation, puzzle solving and combat. The game expands Batman's arsenal of gadgets and combat attacks and offers a more open world structure, allowing the player to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The console versions of Arkham Knight received positive reviews, particularly for its narrative, visuals, gameplay, combat, and world designs, with most criticism given to the emphasis on the Batmobile. The Windows version, however, became the subject of intense criticism due to major performance problems, even on high-end graphics hardware, prompting Warner Bros. to temporarily withdraw that version of the game from sale. Upon its release, the game was the fastest selling game of 2015, and the fastest selling game in the Arkham series, reaching over 5 million units sold globally by October 2015. Rocksteady released additional content for the game, including story-driven missions, challenge maps, and skins for Batman and his allies, as well as new Batmobiles from Batman's history and custom racetracks for them.",technology,9

"DJ Boy, also known as DJ Kid, was designed as a standard side-scrolling beat'em up game partially based on the hip-hop culture of the U.S. cities. What made the game unique at the time was the fact that many of the characters rode around on roller skates rather than walking or running. The premise of the home console game: A young man named Donald J. Boy (DJ Boy) is a roller fighter taking part of an ultimate fight-race known as \""Rollergame\"", taking place in Cigaretch City, located on the outskirts of New York City. Many people were excited to see DJ Boy, but a roller fighter gang known as the Dark Knights want him out of the competition. Their leader, Heavy-Met Tony, calls his gang to kidnap his girlfriend Maria, who also comes into town and defeat DJ Boy. DJ Boy must rescue Maria, defeat the Dark Knights, and win the Rollergame competition in one adventure. The arcade plot tells a different story. Two rollerskaters named Bob & Tom (the two playable characters) were breakdancing to the beat of their boombox, until it got stolen from rollerskater thieves (possibly the Dark Knights), in which they must find and defeat them in order to retrieve what is rightfully theirs. DJ Boy skates across various stages and utilizes hand-to-hand combat moves in order to defeat opponents, culminating with a battle with a boss at the end of each level. Along the path, the player also encounters prizes, which then can be used later to purchase Power-ups from a store located at the end of each level (in the home version, the arcade simply tallied these as points). In the console versions of the game, as another game, River City Ransom, the \""prizes\"" consist of coins that are dropped by defeated enemies, or food items like burgers that restore health.",technology,9
