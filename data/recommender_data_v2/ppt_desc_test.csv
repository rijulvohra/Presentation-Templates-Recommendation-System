"Stingrays are a group of rays, which are cartilaginous fish related to sharks. They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes and consist of eight families: Hexatrygonidae (sixgill stingray), Plesiobatidae (deepwater stingray), Urolophidae (stingarees), Urotrygonidae (round rays), Dasyatidae (whiptail stingrays), Potamotrygonidae (river stingrays), Gymnuridae (butterfly rays), and Myliobatidae (eagle rays). Most stingrays have one or more barbed stingers (modified from dermal denticles) on the tail, which are used exclusively in self-defense. The stinger may reach a length around 35 cm (14 in), and its underside has two grooves with venom glands. The stinger is covered with a thin layer of skin, the integumentary sheath, in which the venom is concentrated. A few members of the suborder, such as the manta and porcupine rays, do not have stingers. Stingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world. Some species, such as Dasyatis thetidis, are found in warmer temperate oceans, and others, such as Plesiobatis daviesi, are found in the deep ocean. The river stingrays, and a number of whiptail stingrays (such as the Niger stingray), are restricted to fresh water. Most myliobatoids are demersal (inhabiting the next-to-lowest zone in the water column), but some, such as the pelagic stingray and the eagle rays, are pelagic. While most stingrays are relatively widespread and not currently threatened, for several species (for example Taeniura meyeni, D. colarensis, D. garouaensis, and D. laosensis), conservation status is more problematic, leading to their being listed as vulnerable or endangered by IUCN. The status of several other species is poorly known, leading to their being listed as data deficient.",nature,525_violet_butterfly.png,1,"This is a Violet PowerPoint template design with funny butterflies flying from the bottom of the slide.

"Prejanopterus is an extinct genus of pterodactyloid pterosaur from the Lower Cretaceous (lower Aptian age) layers of the Leza Formation of La Rioja, Spain. In 1980 a fossil site was discovered near Yacimiento de Fuente Amarga on the western slopes of the Peña Isasa. In 1993 and 1994 ten fossiliferous blocks were recovered, containing numerous disarticulated fossil bones and bone fragments, among them those of a pterosaur. The type species Prejanopterus curvirostra was named and described in 2010 by Carolina Fuentes Vidarte and Manuel Meijide Calvo. The generic name is derived from the village of Préjano and a Latinised Greek pteron, \""wing\"". The specific name is derived from Latin curvus, \""bent\"", and rostrum, \""snout\"", a reference to the distinctive bend to the left which was claimed to be present in all fossils of the snout. A later study indicates that \""there is no genuine sideways bend\"" of the snout, \""but a slight dorsal curvature\"". The same study emended the specific name to curvirostris as the feminine curvirostra had been incorrect. The holotype, F. A. 112, consists of a fragmented snout. Another snout, specimen F. A. 185, is the paratype. Numerous other elements of the skull and the postcrania have been assigned to the species, mostly from the wing, the pelvis and the hindlimbs. A humerus or vertebrae are still lacking. The species represents the best preserved pterosaur known from Spain and the first named from the Early Cretaceous of that country. The bent snout features twenty pairs of small teeth with an oval cross-section. That the curvature is no preservation artefact, a post mortem distortion, is indicated by the fact that both known snouts show it. Remarkably, all lower jaws found are straight. The wing span was initially estimated at 4.26 metres (14.0 ft); however, later studies indicate that the wing span of Prejanopterus was probably not much (if ever) in excess of 2 metres (6.6 ft). The authors have assigned Prejanopterus to the Pterodactyloidea. Using the comparative method they established that no pterodactyloid group has obvious strong affinities to the species. In a later phylogenetic study Pereda-Suberbiola et al. (2012) recovered Prejanopterus as a ctenochasmatoid \""positioned between Pterodactylus and Cycnorhamphus-Gallodactylus\"". A more recent phylogenetic study recovers it as a possible lonchodectid. Cladogram after Pereda-Suberbiola et al.

Adult breeding males are almost entirely black with orange and white shoulders (epaulets), long, wide tails, and a bluish white bill.

"Mississippi Lake is a lake in Lanark County in Ontario, Canada. Ontario's Mississippi River flows northeast and north through the lake. Several small creeks including Cranberry Creek, McCrearys Creek, and McGibbon Creek drain into the lake from adjoining forest and agricultural land. The lake is distinctive for having one side (to the north) that is part of the Canadian shield, while the other is mostly limestone. The lake is a remnant of the old Champlain Sea, which flooded eastern Ontario at the end of last ice age. The former shoreline of the sea can still be traced inland from the north shore of the lake. European settlement of the lake basin began ca. 1816 as settlers moved north of the Rideau into areas such as Franktown. Between the 1860s and 1920s there were steamboats linking Carleton Place to Innisville. The lake has two large and provincially significant wetlands. The larger occurs at the west end of the lake; here the Mississippi River enters the lake through the Innisville wetland, which is also one of the largest wetlands in Lanark County, and is designated an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest. Included within its boundaries is The Mississippi Lake National Wildlife Area. This wetland has large areas of silver maple swamp, flooded only in the spring, and, lower on the shore, important areas of marsh and aquatic vegetation. The western shore of the lake, including Kinch Bay, Code Bay and King Bay, also supports a diverse wetland which ranges from silver maple swamp to large areas of aquatic plants. Loons, bald eagles, osprey and herons are frequently sighted in these habitats. The ospreys and herons also breed inland from the lake, for example in the nearby Scotch Corners Wetland. The provincially significant Blanding's Turtle is known from the lake; its long-term survival likely depends upon sufficient nesting areas. Eels were once abundant, but hydroelectric dams downstream have all but eliminated this species from the lake and the watershed.",nature,2235_sustainability.png,1,Free Sustainability PowerPoint Template is a free green template slide with leaves that you can download for CO2 Emission reduction presentations or other ecology or environment PowerPoint templates and presentations.

"The Kerner grape is an aromatic white grape variety. It was bred in 1929 by August Herold by crossing Trollinger (a red variety also known as Schiava grossa or Vernatsch) and Riesling. Herold was working at a plant breeding station in Lauffen in the Württemberg region of Germany. This station belonged to a state breeding institute headquartered in Weinsberg. It received varietal protection and was released for general cultivation in 1969. Kerner has been named in honour of a poet and physician from Swabia, Justinus Kerner, whose works included songs and poetry on wine. Kerner lived from 1818 to his death in Weinsberg. In 2006 Kerner was the 8th most planted variety in Germany with 4,004 hectares (9,890 acres) and 3.9% of the total vineyard surface. The trend since the mid-1990s is that German plantations of Kerner decrease, just as the case for all other \""new breeds\"" of white varieties, such as Müller-Thurgau and Bacchus. German plantations of Kerner reached their highest point around 1990, with around 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) and 7.5% of the total German vineyard surface. For a while around 1995 it was in fact the third most planted variety in Germany after Riesling and Müller-Thurgau. Kerner is most commonly planted in the German regions of Palatinate, Rheinhessen, Mosel, and Württemberg, but it is also grown in Austria (Styria), Switzerland and the Italian province of South Tyrol. It was introduced into South Tyrol in the early 1970s and awarded Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) status in 1993.",nature,2210_fire_flame.png,1,"This free fire flame PowerPoint template background is a free abstract theme with fireflame design theme that you can download and use for fire emergency or emergency pneumatic, including time to tend and fire emergency lights, fire emergency plan, fire engine as well as water emergency or other fire risks and procedures.

"The Barrens topminnow (Fundulus julisia) is a species of freshwater fish in the Fundulidae family, which is in need of management so that it may continue to and increasingly survive in the wild. There are many potential causes of decline of this species including the invasive western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) that will replace native species on a population level, wadding piscivorous birds preying on adults, and the overall restricted distribution of the species. Managing for this species is vital for its success, but to do so there must be an understanding of the species' characteristics. It is endemic to a small portion of Tennessee in the Elk River and the West Hickory creek of the Cumberland river drainage. living up to only 3 years the life span of F. julisia is very short. In many cases the majority of the population does not even reach that age. Most adult males are eaten by birds because of their bright coloration during breeding season. Current management plans are in place for the improvement of the species such as captive breeding and reintroduction, and also private management of streams and land. Yet, more can be done to aid them in their survival efforts.

"Ulmus davidiana var. japonica 'Thomson' is a hardy, cold-resistant cultivar of the Japanese Elm assessed by the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration (PFRA) Nursery (now the AAFC-PFRA&E Shelterbelt Centre) at Indian Head, Saskatchewan, in the 1970s as part of its shelterbelt tree research.  . The tree was one of a number of Japanese Elms planted in an experimental shelterbelt at Indian Head in 1953.

"James Grieve is an old variety of apple.

"The discography of Roy Orbison (April 23, 1936 – December 6, 1988), a singer-songwriter who found the most success in the early rock and roll era from 1957 to 1964. He later enjoyed success as a member of the Traveling Wilburys and a brief resurgence in the 1980s. At the height of his popularity, 22 of Orbison's songs placed on the U.S. Billboard Top 40 chart, and six peaked in the Top Five, including two Number Ones. In the U.K., Orbison scored ten Top 10 hits between 1960 and 1966, including three No.1 singles. Born and raised in Texas, Orbison got his start in a rockabilly band in high school. He broke into professional music under Sam Phillips at Sun Records, but found only marginal success there. After a couple years writing for other musicians, Orbison recorded several songs at Monument Records under producer Fred Foster. With Foster, Orbison and his frequent songwriting partners Joe Melson and Bill Dees tailored many of Orbison's songs for his unique voice; his most popular songs were dramatic ballads ending with emotional crescendos that showcased his powerful vocals. After his biggest hit in 1964, \""Oh, Pretty Woman\"", Orbison continued to record, but not until 1987 did he find the success he had once known when his single \""In Dreams\"" was used in David Lynch's film Blue Velvet. The next year, Orbison recorded with the supergroup Traveling Wilburys alongside Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and George Harrison.

"The Desert Song is an operetta with music by Sigmund Romberg and book and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, Otto Harbach and Frank Mandel. It was inspired by the 1925 uprising of the Riffs, a group of Moroccan fighters, against French colonial rule. It was also inspired by stories of Lawrence of Arabia aiding native guerrillas. Many tales romanticizing Arab North Africa were in vogue, including Beau Geste and The Son of the Sheik. Originally titled \""Lady Fair\"", after successful out-of-town tryouts in Wilmington, Delaware and Boston, Massachusetts, the original Broadway production opened at the Casino Theatre on November 30, 1926 and ran for a very successful 465 performances. It starred Vivienne Segal. The piece enjoyed a London production and was revived on Broadway in 1946 and 1973. In the 1980s, it was played regularly by the Light Opera of Manhattan and revived by the New York City Opera. It is a popular piece for community light opera groups. The story is a version of plots such as The Scarlet Pimpernel, Zorro and Superman, where a hero adopts a mild-mannered disguise to keep his true identity a secret.

"\""Today Is Your Day\"" is a song performed by Canadian singer-songwriter Shania Twain. It was self-penned by Twain and co-produced by the singer alongside David Foster and Nathan Chapman. The song was released on June 12, 2011 by Mercury Nashville Records, as a promotional single to accompany the documentary television series Why Not? with Shania Twain (2011). The song marked Twain's first song release in over six years. Twain wrote the track for self-inspiration, during the development of Why Not? with Shania Twain. To her, \""Today Is Your Day\"" became the theme song for the series, expressing the purpose behind it via music. Despite feeling apprehensive, Twain decided to record the track, which induced her to create her forthcoming fifth studio album. The track is midtempo ballad in the country pop genre. Lyrically, \""Today Is Your Day\"" regards personal upliftment. \""Today Is Your Day\"" is Twain's first piece of music to have had no involvement with now ex-husband Robert John \""Mutt\"" Lange in 18 years. \""Today Is Your Day\"" has received mixed reviews from music critics and mild commercial performance in Canada and the United States.

"A Kind of Hush is the seventh studio album by American popular music duo Carpenters. It was released in June 11, 1976. By the time of the album's recording, Richard Carpenter's addiction to sleeping pills had begun to affect him professionally, and he blames this for the album being, in his opinion, sub-par. All three excerpted singles became hits. \""There's a Kind of Hush (All Over the World)\"", a cover of a 1960s song by Herman's Hermits, broke both the UK Top 30 and US Top 20, as well as topping the adult contemporary chart. \""I Need to Be in Love\"" hit number 25 in the US and number 36 in the UK. \""Goofus\"" was only a minor success, stalling at number 56 on the Billboard chart, though it did crack the adult contemporary top 10. John Bettis called \""I Need to Be in Love\"" the favorite lyrics he ever wrote for Karen Carpenter. \""If there was ever anything that came out of my heart straight to Karen's I would say that was it. I was very proud of it for that.\"" Richard Carpenter recalled that the song \""became Karen's favorite Carpenters song\"". However, this album was also the first not to have Karen playing drums at all and top Los Angeles session drummer Jim Gordon played the drums on this album. The album, despite its gold certification and a high UK chart placing, was a commercial disappointment in the US where its chart peak was outside the Top 30.

"El Conquistadors is the third official album of Serbian industrial group dreDDup. It was first released in 2009 for the Belgrade record label Insurrection Records. This was the third album that had a complete story behind it. Like the first and second release talked about the past and the future (Mr Borndeads Feast and Future Porn Machine), this album experimented with the dark present tense of mankind. Taking us to the boundaries of the human being and the terrorizing truth that lurks in the shadow of hostile envirement all around. The title is purposely misspelled. The artwork was created entirely by the artist Danica Bicanic and it presented the visual art of dreDDup music. This album also concluded some guest musicians such as DJ Shark Zowie & Briggite. The complete production and studio mastering and mixing was done by miKKa. Album was digitally remastered and re-released for Beast of Prey Records from Poland in May 2010. here is the album manifest taken from dreDDup website: \""Get ready for blood, tears and sperm. This album talks about the present tense and the mankind, the boundaries of ones desires, dreams and mistakes. This is our statement to this rusted world, to these wasted dreams and plastic reality with real life and unreal people. We're sick of mediocrity in their bodies who walk empty streets without any real purpose. This album talks about them, about their sorrow, mistakes and inner demons. Without them we do not exist and without us they are nothing. This is about something real. It's about this fallen mankind. This world has become occupied, surrounded and unhealthy. We do not agree with this worlds systems of values. This is world without values, without inner boundaries that confront served mediocrity. We're so fucking sick of it all, and want to live in some better place, and really feel our childhood energy. So we named our album 'El Conquistadors' (proper Spanish title would be 'El Conquistador') but we want for those smart-ass motherfucking self-masturbating people to say that we're wrong, to say that they know better and to hear from their empty minds what do we need to do to live happy mediocrity life.

"El Conquistadors is the third official album of Serbian industrial group dreDDup. It was first released in 2009 for the Belgrade record label Insurrection Records. This was the third album that had a complete story behind it. Like the first and second release talked about the past and the future (Mr Borndeads Feast and Future Porn Machine), this album experimented with the dark present tense of mankind. Taking us to the boundaries of the human being and the terrorizing truth that lurks in the shadow of hostile envirement all around. The title is purposely misspelled. The artwork was created entirely by the artist Danica Bicanic and it presented the visual art of dreDDup music. This album also concluded some guest musicians such as DJ Shark Zowie & Briggite. The complete production and studio mastering and mixing was done by miKKa. Album was digitally remastered and re-released for Beast of Prey Records from Poland in May 2010. here is the album manifest taken from dreDDup website: \""Get ready for blood, tears and sperm. This album talks about the present tense and the mankind, the boundaries of ones desires, dreams and mistakes. This is our statement to this rusted world, to these wasted dreams and plastic reality with real life and unreal people. We're sick of mediocrity in their bodies who walk empty streets without any real purpose. This album talks about them, about their sorrow, mistakes and inner demons. Without them we do not exist and without us they are nothing. This is about something real. It's about this fallen mankind. This world has become occupied, surrounded and unhealthy. We do not agree with this worlds systems of values. This is world without values, without inner boundaries that confront served mediocrity. We're so fucking sick of it all, and want to live in some better place, and really feel our childhood energy. So we named our album 'El Conquistadors' (proper Spanish title would be 'El Conquistador') but we want for those smart-ass motherfucking self-masturbating people to say that we're wrong, to say that they know better and to hear from their empty minds what do we need to do to live happy mediocrity life. And we're not even going to ask you to listen to this album, no - if you see it just run away from it, hate it, laugh at it, be the one of El Conquistadors who crush worlds without trying to feel them.

"\""Go\"", written and composed by Julie Forsyth, who was a member of the Pop Group Guys 'n' Dolls and is the daughter of English entertainer Bruce Forsyth, was the United Kingdom's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1988, performed by Scott Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald won the right to perform at Dublin by winning the UK national final, A Song for Europe, where he was the eighth singer to perform. Fitzgerald was also the first singer to be chosen to represent the United Kingdom via a national telephone vote. In Dublin, the song was performed fourth on the night, after Finland's Boulevard with \""Nauravat silmät muistetaan\"", and before Turkey's Mazhar-Fuat-Özkan with \""Sufi.\"" At the end of judging that evening, \""Go\"" took the second-place slot with 136 points. Turkey, Belgium and Italy awarded their 12-point designations to the UK that evening. In one of the closest voting rounds up to that time, the UK lost the competition by one point to Switzerland's representative, Canadian singer Celine Dion, with her song \""Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi.\"" According to author and contest historian John Kennedy O'Connor, this was the closest contest yet, with the winning margin being just 0.73%. The strong showing in the 1988 contest was an indicator of things to come for the United Kingdom, as it would become the first of eleven straight Top Ten placings in the Contest, and the first of four second-place finishes in the next six years. In a departure from the past two years, an easy listening ballad was on offer this year, telling the story of two former lovers meeting by chance. Fitzgerald, in the role of the lovesick man, relates the sad story; his former lover had left him years before for another man, and now that she has returned, so has all the sorrow he felt.

"Boonoonoonoos is the fifth studio album by Boney M. It was released in September 1981. Despite producer Frank Farian having announced by the end of 1979 that Boney M. were to take a break, recording sessions for a new album began in the spring of 1980, and the title \""Boonoonoonoos\"" (a Caribbean word for \""Happiness\"") already appeared as one of the first completed tracks, a cover of Larry Dillon's ska-title \""Train to Skaville\"" which was intertwined with new rap parts \""That's Boonoonoonoos\"". Two of the new recordings, \""I See A Boat On The River\"" and \""My Friend Jack\"" were issued to promote The Magic of Boney M. - 20 Golden Hits in May 1980. Farian invited the singers Liz Mitchell and Marcia Barrett and his crew of musicians to Nice in the summer of 1980 where several new songs were recorded. A new double A-side single \""Children Of Paradise\""/\""Gadda-Da-Vida\"" was released in September, announcing the as yet untitled new album to be released in November '80. The single reached number 11 in Germany, but in the UK their popularity was now quickly slipping. When released in February 1981, the single peaked at a disappointing #66. In the meantime, Farian had decided to revise the whole album. While new pressings of \""Children Of Paradise\"" now promoted \""The Magic Of Boney M.\"" on the back cover, the band instead issued another single in December, a cover version of \""Felicidad (Margherita)\"" backed with \""Strange\"". \""Felicidad\"", originally recorded by Italian band Massara as \""Margherita (Love In The Sun)\"" in 1979, managed to get Boney M. into the German Top 10 again (#6, 27 weeks) and it became a sizeable hit in most of Europe as well. The single, however, wasn't released by Atlantic Records UK, nor was it released in Spain or Portugal where Massara's original version had been a huge hit two years earlier. In the Netherlands, the single was released with \""Strange\"" as the A-side.

"TONY! The Blair Musical is a satirical comedy musical written in 2007 by Chris Bush, director of the White Rose Theatre, with music composed by Ian McCluskey. TONY! follows the premiership of former British prime minister Tony Blair from his landslide election in 1997 to his resignation ten years later. It is told to the audience by Blair himself, in the form of an interplay of spotlit monologues and musical flashbacks to various moments in the former prime minister's career. The musical focuses primarily on Blair's relationships with the key characters in his life, rather than the politics, including his Chancellor and successor as Prime Minister Gordon Brown and wife Cherie Booth. It is a musically eclectic production, featuring rock pieces, power ballads and a barbershop quartet of former Tory leaders. Performed at York's Theatre Royal, the Edinburgh Fringe and the Pleasance Theatre, Islington, TONY! has been described by the BBC as \""sharp, engaging and original,\"" and as \""a shining example of honest comedy writing.\"" It has also been criticized for crude caricatures and cheap one-liners. Nonetheless, the play won the NSDF & Pleasance Edinburgh Competition 2007. As part of the prize the production transferred to the Pleasance Theatre, Islington, for a limited run in late September 2007. The production returned to the Edinburgh Fringe in August 2008, alongside its sequel Tony of Arabia.

"The Belenski most (Беленски мост) or Byala Bridge is an arch bridge over the Yantra River in northern Bulgaria, 1 km from the town of Byala in Ruse Province, whose name it carries. It is regarded as one of the prominent achievements of Bulgarian National Revival engineering and architecture. The bridge was constructed between 1865 and 1867 by Bulgarian architect and master builder Kolyu Ficheto on the order of Turkish statesman Midhat Pasha. While other architects were willing to build it for 2 to 3 million liras, Kolyu Ficheto was willing to build it for 700 thousand. When asked to confirm this sum, he replied that Midhat Pasha could take his head if he didn't succeed doing it for this sum. It is 276 m long and 6 m wide, has 14 arches each with a clearance of 12 m and decorated with relief images of animals. Constructed from local limestone and limestone plaster, it is supported by 13 props with cutwaters.

"Maryland Route 404 (MD 404) is a major highway on Maryland's Eastern Shore in the United States. It runs 24.61 miles (39.61 km) from MD 662 in Wye Mills on the border of Queen Anne's and Talbot counties, southeast to the Delaware state line in Caroline County, where the road continues as Delaware Route 404 (DE 404) to Nassau (near Rehoboth Beach). The Maryland and Delaware state highways together cross the width of the Delmarva Peninsula and serve to connect the cities west of the Chesapeake Bay by way of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and U.S. Route 50 (US 50) with the Delaware Beaches. Along the way, MD 404 passes through mostly farmland and woodland as well as the towns of Queen Anne, Hillsboro, and Denton. The road is a two-lane undivided highway for most of its length with the exception of the bypass around Denton and a section near Hillsboro, which is a four-lane divided highway. MD 404 was designated by 1933 to run from Matapeake (where the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis), east along present-day MD 8, US 50, and MD 662 to Wye Mills, where it followed its current routing to the Delaware border. By 1946, the route’s western terminus was moved to MD 2 north of Annapolis, where it headed east across the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point-Matapeake ferry. The western terminus was cut back to Wye Mills in 1949, having been replaced with US 50 west of there. The route was realigned to bypass Queen Anne and Hillsboro in 1960 and Denton in 1987. Since MD 404 is the main route for travelers between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware Beaches, the road has a high accident rate. To improve on this situation, the Maryland State Highway Administration is planning to widen the two-lane portions of the route into a four-lane divided highway. A portion of the road east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County received $7.7 million for widening as a part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009.",transportation,2916_airplane.png,1,Free Airplane Flying Away in Sky PowerPoint Template is an awesome flying PowerPoint background and slide design with an airplane flying away in the sky and sky blue background.

"Lawrence Hargrave Drive is a scenic coastal road and popular tourist drive connecting the northernmost suburbs of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia to both Wollongong and Sydney.

"Interstate 80 (I-80) is a major Interstate Highway in the United States, running from the New York City Metropolitan Area westward to San Francisco, California. The New Jersey Department of Transportation also identifies I-80 as the Christopher Columbus Highway. I-80 in New Jersey runs 68.54 miles (110.30 km) from the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge over the Delaware River at the Delaware Water Gap to its eastern terminus at I-95 in Teaneck, Bergen County. I-95 continues from the end of I-80 to the George Washington Bridge for access to New York City; access is also provided via the I-280 spur towards the Holland Tunnel and US 46 to Route 3, or I-95, towards the Lincoln Tunnel. Throughout New Jersey, I-80 runs parallel to US 46. The highway heads through rural areas of Warren and Sussex counties before heading into more suburban surroundings in Morris County. As the road continues into Passaic and Bergen counties, it heads into more urban areas. A freeway along the I-80 corridor had been planned in 1936 and again in 1955 to provide relief along US 46 between the George Washington Bridge and the Delaware Water Gap. With the establishment of the Interstate Highway System, this planned freeway, which had been identified in some planning documents as the Bergen-Passaic Expressway, would be incorporated into I-80. The freeway was built across New Jersey in various stages from the 1960s to 1973. The westernmost four miles in New Jersey was originally a rerouting of US 611 when built; that route was later realigned back into Pennsylvania. In the 1990s, high-occupancy vehicle lanes had existed on a part of I-80 in Morris County but were opened to regular traffic due to underuse. The Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge and its approach is planned to be widened from four to six lanes, with construction beginning in 2015.",transportation,2836_sportscar.png,1,"Free Sportscar PowerPoint Template is a free background and sports slide design for presentations that you can download to prepare awesome presentations on sports and races.

"The Loren Bridge (Russian: Мост через реку Лорен) is a unique bridge that crosses the Loren River, and is located in Chukotsky District, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia. The two-way bridge is 113 metres long and six metres wide and was built to connect the roads between the towns of Lavrentiya and Lorino. Construction required the structure to span a river delta, a notable engineering feat in Russia's Far East. The first bridge crossing the Loren was constructed in the 1990s, but the difficult Arctic conditions quickly led to the bridge falling into disrepair. The old bridge was deemed unfit for use and is in the process of dismantlement in favor of the new Loren Bridge. Building of the new bridge started in 2007 in Vladivostok, where the structure was designed and materials were assembled in order to ship them to the bridge site. In 2008, the FESCO shipping company delivered construction materials and cement for building of the new crossing by boat from the port of Vladivostok to Lorino. The Steam-ship \""Amur\"" was dispatched for the task on June, 12th 2008. Initial estimates had the bridge being open to the public on October, 30th, 2009.The bridge opened on November, 2nd, 2009, when the commission led by the Chief of the Department of Building, Reconstruction and Repair of Highways and Management of Highways, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Evgeny Bessonov officially approved the structure for use by the public.

The route is Mayo's second busiest road after the N5 with almost 10,000 vehicles daily using the route between Ballina and Foxford. The route diverges from the N5 near Swinford and passes through that town. It runs northwest to Foxford where the road meets the N58 (which runs south back to the N5). From here the route turns north to Ballina. At Ballina the road meets the N59 which runs east-west through the town. The section between Foxford and Swinford is of very sub-standard quality and has an extremely narrow bridge over the River Moy at Callow, where two large vehicles cannot pass at the same time. The dangerous bridge is located on a double bend and interrupts the flow of traffic hugely. The N26 is the first \""extra\"" allocation of a national primary route other than the original 25. There are now primary routes up to N33. The physical upgrading, or modernisation, of the road has been in the planning stages for over 10 years. The proposed upgrading of the N26 was divided into two phases with the first phase (5 km) just south of Ballina opening to traffic in December 2004, this new section eliminated a dangerous stretch and has much improved the approach into Ballina town. The second phase (19 km in length) from Carrowntrella-Bohola was planned to be of type two dual-carriageway standard and would have bypassed Foxford and Swinford. It would also have been the first dual carriageway ever constructed in Co Mayo and was to join the N5 just west of Bohola.However, planning permission for the project was denied by An Bord Pleanala in 2010 and the road is now being redesigned.",transportation,160347-train.png,1,"Free Train PowerPoint Template is a new and amazing design for presentation.

"Elgin Bridge is a 3695 ft long important railway bridge across the Ghaghra River located in Barabanki district. The bridge falls on the Barabanki-Gonda section of the North Eastern Railway zone of Indian Railways. The bridge is about 73 km from Lucknow and stands at periodically changing confluence of two rivers i.e. Sharda River and Ghaghara River. The bridge was built on dry land and then the river was trained under it. The bridge was completed in 1896 and opened on 18 December 1896 with the opening of Jarwal Road - Behramghat section of the Bengal and North Western Railway. The bridge is named after Lord Elgin, Governor-General of India (21 March 1862 – 20 November 1863). Before construction of Elging Bridge and opening of railways between Gonda and Barabanki most of the trade was done by the river route, once the bridge was constructed the river trade decreased greatly. The bridge is an important point of experiment, research and monitoring for irrigation and flood related activities. There is a flood water level recording and forecasting station at the Elgin Bridge which records rise and fall in the Ghaghra River.

"The Cameron Suspension Bridge crosses the Little Colorado River at Cameron, Arizona, USA. The bridge formerly carried U.S. Route 89, but was replaced by a newer deck truss bridge in 1959. Built in 1911, it has an overall length of 680 feet (210 m) and a main span of 660 feet (200 m). The bridge was built by the Midland Bridge Company of Kansas City for the Office of Indian Affairs and the Indian Irrigation Service. W. H. Code of the Midland Bridge Company was the designer. The suspension design was chosen to address the steep-walled canyon at the crossing, which required a single span with no temporary falsework. When built, the Cameron bridge was the longest suspension span west of the Mississippi River. The bridge towers rest on the rim of the canyon, with concrete deadmen anchoring the suspension cables some way back from the towers. The deck is stiffened by a Pratt through-truss, with a 14-foot (4.3 m) wide roadway. The bridge was built to improve access to the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Indian Reservation. Named for U.S. Senator Ralph H. Cameron, it was an important link for the construction of the Navajo Bridge on US 89 across the Colorado River in 1929. The town of Cameron grew up around the crossing, which in addition to opening up the Native American lands to the north, also provided a northern gateway to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon when the Navajo Bridge opened. The bridge was damaged by an overload of sheep in 1937, when it almost collapsed. The damage was repaired and the bridge served highway traffic until 1959. It was sold to the Four Corners Pipeline Company when the new bridge opened, and carries a natural gas pipeline. It is the oldest suspension bridge in Arizona, and one of only two of that type in the state. The Cameron Suspension bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 5, 1986.",transportation,160806-trucking.png,1,"Free Shipping Containers PowerPoint Template with images of colored boxes is a creative background design for lecture or business presentations on transportation or logistics.

"The Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2, also known as LRT Line 2, LRT-2, or Megatren, is a rapid transit line in Metro Manila in the Philippines, generally running in an east-west direction along the Radial Road 6 and a portion of the Circumferential Road 1. Although operated by the Light Rail Transit Authority, resulting in its being called \""LRT-2\"", it is actually a heavy rail, rapid transit system owing to its use of electric multiple units instead of the light rail vehicles used in earlier lines and is the only line utilizing such type of system in the country. Envisioned in the 1970s as part of the Metropolitan Manila Strategic Mass Rail Transit Development Plan, the eleven-station, 13.8-kilometer (8.6 mi) line was the third rapid transit line to be built in Metro Manila when it started operations in 2003. It is operated by the Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA), a government-owned and controlled corporation under the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) under an official development assistance scheme. Serving close to 200,000 passengers daily, LRT-2 is the least busy among Metro Manila's three rapid transit lines, and was built with standards such as barrier-free access and the use of magnetic card tickets to facilitate passenger access in mind. Total ridership however is significantly below the line's built maximum capacity, with various solutions being proposed or implemented to increase ridership in addition to the planned extensions to the line. However, the short-term solutions have had a minimal effect on ridership, and experts have insisted that the extensions be built immediately, despite pronouncements that the system is steadily increasing ridership each year. LRT-2 is integrated with the public transit system in Metro Manila, and passengers also take various forms of road-based public transport, such as buses and jeepneys, to and from a station to reach their intended destination. Although the line aimed to reduce traffic congestion and travel times along R-6 and portions of C-1, the transportation system has only been partially successful due to the rising number of motor vehicles and rapid urbanization. Expanding the network's revenue line to accommodate more passengers is set on tackling this problem.",history,160412-pyramid.png,0,"Free Pyramid PowerPoint Template is a wonderful design for history related presentations.

"The Darlington's Bridge at Delaware Station was a highway bridge over the Delaware River in the community of Delaware, New Jersey (known locally as Delaware Station). Formerly a railroad bridge constructed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1871 to replace an earlier 1855 timber span, the bridge was sold off when the new one upstream was constructed. Henry V. Darlington, an Episcopal minister in Delaware and nearby Belvidere offered to buy the second-hand bridge for $5,000 (1914 USD, equal to $118,123 today). Darlington converted it into a highway bridge, using two fired members of the nearby Meyer's Ferry to be toll collectors. The bridge prospered, becoming a part of State Highway Route 6 in 1927 and U.S. Route 46 in 1936. In 1932, during the massive state takeover of bridges by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, Darlington refused offers, bargaining his way up to $275,000 (1932 USD, equal to $4,769,573 today) before accepting the sale. This amount was a far cry from the nearby Belvidere-Riverton and Portland-Columbia Covered Bridge, which were accepted for $60,000 (equal to $1,040,634 today) and $50,000 (equal to $867,195 today) respectively. On that moment, tolls along the bridge and Route 6 were eliminated. The bridge prospered toll-free for another 21 years, until the construction of the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge upstream at Columbia. Although Reverend Darlington was still alive to see all this transpire, the Commission ceased operations on the Darlington Bridge on April 3, 1954, and the bridge was immediately demolished.",transportation,2836_sportscar.png,1,"Free Sportscar PowerPoint Template is a free background and sports slide design for presentations that you can download to prepare awesome presentations on sports and races.

"The Gasworks Bridge, also known as the Old Gasworks Bridge, is an iron bridge across the River Thames at Oxford in England. It is a pedestrian bridge linking St Ebbes to the Grandpont nature reserve. It crosses the river on the reach between Iffley Lock and Osney Lock. The bridge was constructed by the Oxford & District Gas Company in 1886 for a short railway branch line to carry coal to the gas works from the main Cherwell Valley Line at a junction just south of Osney Rail Bridge. The bridge was built by assembling sections on the south bank of the river and floating them into position. The gas works was demolished in 1960; no evidence of the railway line is visible on the footbridge. Since the demolition of the gas works, other names have been used for the bridge. For a few years after the closure of the railway it appears to have been crossed by a private road, and the Environment Agency refers to the bridge simply as \""Road Bridge\"", although no road now crosses it. The bridge is now usually referred to by its old name. It has occasionally been referred to as Osney Footbridge, although the bridge is some distance from Osney, and that name is also used for a different bridge.",nature,160961-dog.png,0,"Dogs are kept and loved around the globe being a faithful and cute animal.

The prize paper was to be published in Acta Mathematica, but after the issue containing the paper was printed, Poincaré found an error that invalidated his proof. He paid more than the prize money to destroy the print run and reprint the issue without his paper, and instead published a corrected paper a year later in the same journal that demonstrated that the system could be unstable.

"The Rafu Shimpo (羅府新報 Rafu Shinpō) is a Japanese-English language newspaper based in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, California. The paper began in 1903 as a one-page, mimeographed Japanese-language newspaper produced by Rippo Iijima, Masaharu Yamaguchi, and Seijiro Shibuya. H. T. Komai became publisher in 1922, beginning a family dynasty. He was succeeded by son Akira and grandson Michael. The name of the newspaper essentially translates as \""Los Angeles area newspaper\"" (\""ra\"" abbreviated from \""rashogiri\"", said to be a Chinese name for Los Angeles, \""fu\"" meaning \""prefecture\"", and \""shinpo\"", a term for newspaper). Togo Tanaka, the editor of the paper's English language section, appealed unsuccessfully to the United States government to allow the paper to continue printing in the event of war with Japan, and oversaw the paper's last edition before he was sent to the Manzanar internment camp. The paper ceased publication in 1942 due to the Japanese American Internment. It was revived in 1946, due to Akira Komai's foresight and the loyalty of his employees. Komai had arranged for the paper's rent to be paid during the war and hid the Japanese type under the floorboards. In March 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported that The Rafu Shimpo was losing circulation and money, and was the target of community drives hoping to save the newspaper from going out of business. On March 25, 2016, publisher Michael Komai released an \""open letter\"" stating that the paper had lost $750,000 over the past three years, was projected to lose $350,000 in 2016, and would have to close at the end of the year unless its finances improved.",history,1649_mythology.png,1,Mythology PowerPoint Template is a free PowerPoint template with a unicorn illustration design in the slide that you can download for presentations on mythology or Pegasus PowerPoint presentations.

"Morgunblaðið (Icelandic pronunciation: [ˈmɔrkʏnˌplaðɪð], The Morning Paper) is a newspaper published in Iceland, founded by Vilhjálmur Finsen and Olaf Björnsson, brother of the first president. The first issue, only eight pages long, was published on 2 November 1913. In 1919, the corporation Árvakur bought out the company. The paper had a close relationship with the conservative Independence Party (Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn), especially during the Cold War, and its editors or their parliamentary reporters routinely sat in on meetings of the parliamentary party until 1983 when Geir Hallgrímsson, Chairman of the Board of Árvakur and also the Chairman of the Independence Party, decided that this relationship was in the best interests of neither the party nor the newspaper. Although its connection with the Independence Party is not as direct as in previous decades, the newspaper is sometimes criticised for leaning too much towards the party, especially at election times. Although the paper shares the mainstream conservative values of the Independence Party, it has also shown its independence on some key issues, especially in the debate on fishing rights distribution. Lately the paper has made a point of recruiting left-leaning journalists and has echoed feminist policies on the op-ed pages. Morgunblaðið is opposed to Icelandic membership of the European Union. Since its initial publication, Morgunblaðið was until 2003 not published on Mondays. It soon established itself as the newspaper of record. It was always the number one newspaper in Iceland, and it took an absolute lead in the early 1970s and routed most of the competition, enjoying an unchallenged superiority for the next three decades. During this period, Morgunblaðið launched a number of special sections on finance, fisheries, food etc. After the rival Fréttablaðið, delivered free to homes, took the competition to a new level by starting a Monday edition, Morgunblaðið responded to the challenge and has since 2003 been published every day of the week, with 60 to 120 pages. Advertising accounts for 30% to 40% of the column space. Daily circulation hovers between 50,000 and 55,000, the bulk being paid subscriptions. Circulation is mostly focused on the southwestern part of the country, especially the capital Reykjavík and nearby settlements. As a result of the Icelandic financial crisis, 24 stundir, published by Morgunblaðið, ceased publication on 10 October 2008, resulting in 20 jobs being cut. In a controversial decision, the owners of the paper decided in September 2009 to appoint Davíð Oddsson, a member of the Independence Party, Iceland's longest-serving Prime Minister and former head of the Central Bank, as one of the two editors of the paper.

"Pierre Culliford (French: [kylifɔʁ]; 25 June 1928 – 24 December 1992) was a Belgian cartoonist who worked under the pseudonym Peyo ([pejo]). His best-known works are the comic strips The Smurfs and Johan and Peewit, in which the Smurfs first appeared. After working briefly at a Belgian animation studio, Peyo began making comic strips for daily newspapers such as Le Soir shortly after World War II. At the beginning of the 1950s he brought his character Johan to the magazine Spirou, whom he soon gave a companion, the diminutive Peewit; the strip soon became a staple of the weeklies. Peyo introduced the Smurfs in the Johan and Peewit storyline The Magic Flute in 1958; the characters quickly supplanted Johan and Peewit in popularity and left them behind for their own series. In 1960 Peyo founded a studio to accommodate his assistants such as François Walthéry, Gos, and Marc Wasterlain, and created the series Steven Strong and Jacky and Célestin. Peyo's output diminished in the 1970s, at first due to the time he invested in the film The Smurfs and the Magic Flute (1976); in the 1980s he put in more time, despite recurring health problems, into an American adaptation of The Smurfs as an animated television series. After the series concluded he left his publisher Dupuis to found his own publishing house, Cartoon Creation, and a cartoon magazine, Schtroumpf!, which soon folded due to management problems. He joined Le Lombard in 1992, but died a few months later. Since his death, Peyo's children have continued to promote his work under the brand \""Peyo\"".",art,161078-decoration.png,1,"Free Christmas Bulbs PowerPoint Template is an awesome template design for presentations on decoration and embellishing the site.

"Mia Brownell is an American painter whose work has been described by the Boston Globe art critic Cate McQuaid as \""a 21st-century take on the 17th-century genre, pulled off with thrilling technique -- a postmodern fruit cocktail that marries today's fascination with genetics and the building blocks of life with old-style painterly seduction.\""Donald Kuspit, American art critic, says of Brownell's Art at a 2010 exhibition: \""Brownell’s nature has been \""modernized\"" and demystified, in that its genetic and cellular basis have been spelled out scientifically, but it remains mysterious—even absurdly miraculous—for it continues to produce, with patient inevitability, the fruits of life. ... Brownell’s paintings are about the bizarre look nature has when seen from a scientific perspective, that is, reductively understood in scientific terms: They are about the estranging, unnatural effect the scientific conception of nature has on the appreciative perception of it.\""Brownell was born in 1971 in Chicago, Illinois to a sculptor, Nancy J. Schulson and a biophysicist, William E. Brownell. Mia began her academic training as a painter at the age of fourteen at the Baltimore School for the Arts. She attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the State University of New York, Buffalo. Her paintings are in several private, corporate, and public art collections including the National Academy of Sciences. In 2014 a traveling ten-year survey of her work accompanied a solo exhibition in New York City titled: “Delightful, Delicious, Disgusting: Paintings by Mia Brownell 2003-2013.” The exhibit traveled to museums in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.

Consolidation began in 1922 and, in 1956, the Lake Fenton Community School (essentially West Shore Elementary and Torrey Hill Middle School) was built to replace the one-room schools. The school itself sat on the site of one of the one-room schools, the former Long Lake School. Then, in 1959, the first Lake Fenton High School was built, being added onto the Community School. In time, West Shore and Torrey Hill moved to a new building in Lahring Road, and the high school occupied the 1956 school building. Today, Torrey Hill is an intermediate school, the original high school a middle school and a new high school has been built on Lahring Road in Fenton Township.",education,310_sphere_mesh.png,1,"This design has a black background and spheres in different colors.

"Mandeville School is a secondary school in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, built in the 1960s. There are approximately 1000 students currently attending Mandeville, aged between 11 and 18 years. As recently as 2000 the school had a reputation as a failing school. It failed OFSTED inspections and was forced to close to students for one day each week because of a lack of available teachers. However this was rectified very quickly only resulting in a single 4-day week. The school has since had an improvement, resulting in a 3 from Ofsted. It continues to improve under the leadership of Andria Hanham, Principal, who took on the role in November 2015.

However, due to an embezzlement scandal involving the former chairman of the school, who channeled approximately 3.6 billion Korean Won of tuition to his personal use, the school's reputation plummeted and its budget was crippled. Several teachers have also complained implicitly that they have not been compensated for their work a number of years ago. Reports say that the teacher situation in regards to pay was resolved around 2007. A sizeable portion of the parents and the students left Indianhead International School, with some headed to Korean public schools while others, to other international schools in Korea.

"3552 Don Quixote, provisionally designated 1983 SA, is a near-Earth asteroid (NEA), also classified as Amor, Mars-crossing, and Jupiter-crossing asteroid.

It was discovered by Paul Wild at the Swiss Zimmerwald Observatory in 1983, and is named after the comic knight who is the eponymous hero of Cervantes' Spanish novel Don Quixote (1605). Due to its comet-like orbit and albedo, Don Quixote has ever been suspected to be an extinct comet. However, infrared observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope at 4.5 μm revealed a faint coma and tail around the object. The cometary activity is interpreted as CO2 molecular band emission.

"(5648) 1990 VU1 is a carbonaceous Jupiter trojan from the Trojan camp, approximately 60 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 11 November 1990, by Japanese amateur astronomers Kin Endate and Kazuro Watanabe at the Kitami Observatory on the northern island of Hokkaidō, Japan. The C-type Jovian asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.3–6.0 AU once every 11 years and 8 months (4,274 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 23° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in 1950, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 40 years prior to its discovery. Photometric observations of this asteroid during 1994 were used to build a light curve showing a rotation period of 37.56 ± 0.05 hours with a brightness variation of 0.20 ± 0.03 magnitude. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 59.3 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.073, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a somewhat larger diameter of 66.9 kilometers, as the lower a body's albedo (reflectivity), the larger its diameter, at a constant absolute magnitude (brightness).",history,160755-learn.png,0,"Knowledge is power is an admitted proverb around the world and education is a teaching-learning process that relates to the book reading.

"789 Lena, provisional designation 1914 UU, is an asteroid from the middle region of the asteroid belt, approximately 24 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 24 June 1914, by Soviet–Russian astronomer Grigory Neujmin at Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. The X-type asteroid is also classified as a M-type by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.3–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 5 months (1,608 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.15 and an inclination of 11° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. Although its orbital elements resemble those of the asteroids in the Eunomia family, true members of this family have a S-type composition, so it is almost certainly an unrelated interloper. The first used observation was made much later at the U.S Yerkes Observatory in 1935, reducing the asteroid's observation arc by 21 years with respect to its discovery date. In 1993, a rotational light-curve which was later proven incorrect, was obtained from photometric observations at the Félix Aguilar Observatory, Argentina. It gave an unusual light-curve, indicating a very irregular shape and/or a relatively long rotation period of 22 hours with an exceptionally high amplitude of 1.5 in magnitude (U=0). In August and September 2007, two new light-curves were obtained by Italian astronomer Silvano Casulli and by members at the U.S.Oakley Observatory, and gave a period of 5.848±0.001 and 5.85±0.05 hours, with a brightness variation of 0.50 and of 0.40 in magnitude, respectively (U=3/2+). According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of the WISE telescope, the asteroid has an albedo of 0.19 and 0.14, with a diameter of 20.6 and 23.9 kilometers, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a much lower albedo of 0.10 and calculates a diameter of 24.2 kilometer, as the lower the albedo (reflectivety), the larger a body's diameter, at a constant absolute magnitude (brightness). The minor planet was named in honor of Elena (\""Lena\"") Petrovna Neujmina (1860–1942), mother of the discovering astronomer.",technology,160093-tablet.png,0,Free Technology Device PowerPoint Template is a new and latest design presented at FPPT.com.

"12564 Ikeller, provisional designation 1998 SO49, is a stony Koronis asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by German amateur astronomer Wolf Bickel at his private Bergisch Gladbach Observatory on 22 September 1998. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Koronis family, which is named after 158 Koronis and consists of about 300 known bodies. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–2.9 AU once every 4 years and 9 months (1,743 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and a typically low inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was obtained at ESO's La Silla Observatory in 1988, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 10 years prior to its discovery. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 5.4 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.22, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 and thus calculates a smaller diameter of 5.2 kilometers, as the higher the albedo (reflectivity), the smaller the body's diameter at a constant absolute magnitude (brightness). In August 2012, a photometric light-curve analysis at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory, California, rendered a rotation period of 7.0423±0.0196 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.44 in magnitude (U=2).

It was discovered by American astronomer Carl Otto Lampland at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, on March 24, 1931. The X-type asteroid is a member of the Eos family and classified as a XSCU and Xc subtype in the Tholen and SMASS taxonomy, respectively. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.3 AU once every 5 years and 3 months (1,920 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.10 and is tilted by 9 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. Its rotation has been measured several times with resulting periods between 6 and 8 hours. Observations by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, and by the Japanese satellite Akari, measured an albedo of 0.10 and 0.14, respectively. The asteroid was named after American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh (1906–1997), famous for his discovery of Pluto in 1930. The Lowell Observatory named the body on the occasion of a symposium on Pluto, held in 1980. When Tombaugh examined the photographic plates during the trans-Saturnian search program at the Lowell Observatory, he also marked over 4,000 minor planets on these plates.",technology,160808-computer.png,0,"The invention of the computer has made our jobs easy, fast and reliable enabling millions of freelance workers around the world.

"13154 Petermrva, provisional designation 1995 RC, is a stony Flora asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.2 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 7 September 1995, by Slovak astronomers Adrián Galád and Alexander Pravda at the Modra Observatory in the Bratislava Region of Slovakia. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 3 months (1,200 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Crimea-Nauchnij in 1972, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 23 years prior to its discovery. Two well-defined photometric light-curve analysis at the Modra and Ondřejov Observatory rendered a rotation period of 2.98502±0.00004 and 2.9848±0.0002 hours, with a brightness amplitude of 0.18 and 0.14 in magnitude, respectively (U=3/3). According to the thermal observation carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.2 kilometer and has an untypically low albedo of 0.15.

The satellite operated successfully, however its film capsule was lost during recovery due to a parachute failure. The launch of FTV-1132 occurred at 20:39 UTC on 1 September 1962. A Thor DM-21 Agena-B rocket was used, flying from Launch Complex 75-3-5 at the Vandenberg Air Force Base. Upon successfully reaching orbit, it was assigned the Harvard designation 1962 Alpha Upsilon 1. FTV-1132 was operated in a low Earth orbit, with a perigee of 288 kilometres (179 mi), an apogee of 670 kilometres (420 mi), 82.8 degrees of inclination, and a period of 94.2 minutes. The satellite had a mass of 1,150 kilograms (2,540 lb), and was equipped with a frame camera with a focal length of 76 millimetres (3.0 in), which had a maximum resolution of 140 metres (460 ft). Images were recorded onto 127-millimeter (5.0 in) film, and returned in a Satellite Recovery Vehicle, before the satellite ceased operations. The Satellite Recovery Vehicle used by FTV-1132 was SRV-600. Following atmospheric reentry, SRV-600 was to have been collected in mid-air by a Fairchild C-119J Flying Boxcar aircraft, however when this was attempted the parachute separated from the spacecraft, causing the capsule to fall into the sea. FTV-1132 decayed from orbit on 26 October 1964.",technology,1860_navigation.png,0,Navigation PowerPoint Template is a free PowerPoint template with arrows in different directions that you can download for free for Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 and 2007 presentations to decorate your slides for presentations on navigation or GPS related presentations.

"1840 Hus, provisional designation 1971 UY, is a carbonaceous asteroid dwelling the outer regions of the asteroid belt. It was discovered on 26 October 1971 by Czech astronomer Luboš Kohoutek at Bergedorf Observatory in Hamburg, Germany. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.9–3.0 AU once every 5 years (1,821 days). It has a rotation period of 4.780 hours. The asteroid is calculated to measure about 27 kilometers in diameter and to have a geometric albedo of 0.06, as assumed by the Light Curve Database project (LCDB). These figures strongly deviate from observations made by the NEOWISE survey, that indicated the body to be only half the size with a higher albedo of 0.25, which would be rather unusual if it were a C-type asteroid, as assumed by the LCDB project. It is named after Czech Jan Hus (1372–1415), a fifteenth century Bohemian theologian, rector of Charles University in Prague and forerunner of the protestant reformation. He was condemned to death by the Council of Constance and burned at the stake for his reformation ideas. Jan Hus is also known as John Huss in the English speaking world.",sports,160165-cyclist.png,0,"Cycling is a superb exercise for health and fitness.

"HD 136118 b is a brown dwarf located approximately 171 light-years away in the constellation of Serpens Cauda. This object had a minimum mass of 11.9 times that of Jupiter. Due to its high mass the planet is likely to be very hot and possibly glowing faintly. The lower limit on its mass is only slightly less than the deuterium burning threshold that some astronomers use to distinguish between planets and brown dwarfs. Depending on the inclination of its orbit, the true mass could be above this limit. The orbit of the object is located at the average distance of 1.45 astronomical units from the parent star, taking 40 months to complete one eccentric orbit. On November 25, 2009, its inclination was calculated to be 163.1° and its true mass 42 times that of Jupiter, classifying this as a brown dwarf.",music,593_melody_powerpoint.png,0,"Melody PowerPoint is a PPT template with music notes over an orange background.

"21558 Alisonliu, provisional designation 1998 QW77, is a stony Eunomia asteroid from the middle region of the asteroid belt, approximately 8.5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research at the U.S. Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site in Socorro, New Mexico, on 24 August 1998. The asteroid is a member of the Eunomia family, a large group of S-type asteroids and the most prominent family in the intermediate main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.2–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,598 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 12° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at the Venezuelan OAN de Llano del Hato in 1992, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 6 years prior to its discovery. A rotational light-curve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations made at the Australian Oakley Southern Sky Observatory (E09) in April 2010. The light-curve gave a well-defined rotation period of 4.866±0.003 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.12 in magnitude (U=3). According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 8.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.23, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.21 and calculates a diameter of 8.4 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 12.7. The minor planet was named after Alison Liu (b. 1989) who was awarded Intel Best of Category in the 2006 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) for her behavioral and social science team project. In addition, she received the EU Contest for Young Scientists Award. At the time, Liu attended the Manhasset Secondary School in the U.S. state of New York.

"2578 Saint-Exupery, provisional designation 1975 VW3, is an asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, roughly 22 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Russian female astronomer Tamara Smirnova at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj on 2 November 1975. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.3 AU once every 5 years and 2 months (1,899 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.10 and is tilted by 11 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. Little is known about the asteroids size, composition, albedo and rotation, despite having a well-observed orbit with the lowest possible uncertainty (i.e. a condition code of 0) and an observation arc that spans over a period of more than 60 years. Based on its absolute magnitude of 11.5, its diameter could be anywhere between 13 and 30 kilometers, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25. Since most asteroids in the outer main-belt are of a carbonaceous rather than of a silicaceous composition, with low albedos, typically around 0.05, the asteroid's diameter might be on the upper end of NASA's published conversion table, as the lower the reflectivity (albedo), the larger the body's diameter for a given absolute magnitude. On the other hand, based on its orbital elements such as its semi-major axis, eccentricity and inclination, the body might be a member of the Eos family, which are well known for mostly being of stony composition with a relatively high albedo. Hence, Saint-Exupery's diameter would be closer to 13 kilometers. The minor planet was named in honour of French aviator and writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (1900–1944). The name is appropriate, as Saint-Exupéry's best-known character, The Little Prince, lives on an asteroid. In the book, the little prince's asteroid also has a unique code: B612, which does not a match the minor planet's provisional designation. However, there is another asteroid called 46610 Bésixdouze, which is French for \""B-six-twelve\"" (B612 in hexadecimal notation equals 46610).",art,161113-color.png,0,"Free Color Splash PowerPoint Template is a wonderful and awesome colorful design that has a mixture of colors i.e, red and blue for use as the title slide.

"2537 Gilmore, provisional designation 1951 RL, is an Eunomia asteroid from the middle region of the asteroid belt, approximately 7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 4 September 1951, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory in southern Germany. The asteroid is a member of the Eunomia family, a large group of S-type asteroids and the most prominent family in the intermediate main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.2–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,581 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 13° with respect to the ecliptic. As no precoveries were taken, the asteroid's observation arc begins with its discovery in 1951. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 7.2 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.309, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.21 and calculates a diameter of 6.7 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.19. Two rotational light-curves for this asteroid were obtained from photometric observations at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory, California, from January to February 2014. The light-curves gave a rotation period of 4.230±0.020 and 4.2302±0.0399 hours with a brightness variation of 0.34 and 0.35 in magnitude, respectively (U=2/2). The minor planet was named in honor of New Zealand astronomer couple Alan C. Gilmore and his wife , Pamela (née Kilmartin), two very productive observers of comets and minor planet in the Southern Hemisphere. They research at the Mount John University Observatory since 1980, and are members of the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand. Naming citation was published on 24 July 1983 (M.P.C. 8064), based on a proposal by Conrad Bardwell (see 1615 Bardwell) and Brian G. Marsden.

"192 Nausikaa is a large main-belt S-type asteroid. It was discovered by Johann Palisa on February 17, 1879 at Pula, then in Austria, now in Croatia. The name derives from Nausicaä, a princess in Homer's Odyssey. This is an S-type asteroid around 86 km with an elliptical ratio of 1.51. The sidereal rotation period is 13.6217 hours. Based on the lightcurve data obtained from Nausikaa, a possible satellite was reported in 1985. However, this has not been confirmed. A shape model of Nausikaa has been constructed, also based on the lightcurve data. It indicates a roughly cut, but not very elongated body. In 1998 an occultation of a star by the asteroid was observed from the United States. In 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but the effort came up empty. Nausikaa's orbital period is 3.72 years, its distance from the Sun varying between 1.81 and 2.99 AU. The orbital eccentricity is 0.246. Nausikaa brightened to magnitude 8.3 at a quite favorable opposition on 2 September 2011, when it was 1.875 AU from the Sun and 0.866 AU from the Earth.",sports,160167-lift.png,0,"Chair lifts are awesome to enjoy the pleasures of a hilly area.

"449 Hamburga is a large Main belt asteroid that was discovered by German astronomers Max Wolf and A. Schwassmann on October 31, 1899 in Heidelberg. It is classified as a C-type asteroid and is probably composed of carbonaceous material. It is named for the city of Hamburg in Germany. The name was announced in 1901 during a festival held by the Mathematical Society of Hamburg. In the 1980s and 1990s, NASA considered a spacecraft mission to the asteroid, including a tie-in with McDonald's. The mission plan called for a launch in 1995 and a flyby of Hamburga in early 1998. In August 1988 in the United States' city of Baltimore, a P. Weissman addressed the International Astronomical Union on a mission to this asteroid (449), a mission which also include a rendezvous with Comet Kopf. See Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby for more on the mission to the comet. This mission can also be compared to Rosetta, which successfully flew by two minor planets and orbited a Comet during its approach to the Sun in the early 21st century. P. Weissman later worked on the Rosetta mission It was predicted that 449 occulted the star HIP 1424 in July 2013. 449 Hamburga was identified as one of three asteroids that were likely to be a parent body for chondrites along with 304 Olga and 335 Roberta. All three asteroids were known to have low-albedo (not reflect as much light) and be close to \""meteorite producing resonances\"". Chrondrites are the most common type of meteor found on Earth, accounting for over 80% of all meteors. They are named for the tiny spherical silicate particles that are found inside them (those particles are called chondrules).",nature,160406-leaf.png,0,"The nature has a fresh and charming effects on the eyes and minds of beholder.

"Intelsat 5 (aka IS-5, PAS-5 and Arabsat 2C) was a satellite providing television and communication services for ITSO and Inmarsat, which it was jointly commissioned by. It was manufactured by Aeronutronics. At beginning of life, it generates nearly 10 kilowatts. This version takes advantage of such advances as dual-junction gallium arsenide solar cells, new battery technology and the first commercial use of a high-efficiency xenon ion propulsion system (XIPS). PanAmSat became HSC's first customer to launch the new model, on Aug. 28, 1997, on a Russian Proton-K Blok-DM3 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. PAS-5 provides satellite services in the Americas, with access to Europe, including direct-to-home television services in Mexico. Controllers began noticing degradation of the nickel-hydrogen battery in PAS-5 earlier 1998. The effect on operations was analyzed in June 1998. During periods of peak solar eclipse, which occur twice a year, PanAmSat will be required to shut off a portion of the satellite's payload for some time. PanAmSat reportedly received a compensation of US$185 million from its insurers after the satellite was declared a \""total loss\"" because its capacity was reduced by more than 50 percent. PAS 5 was leased in May 2002 to the Arab Satellite Communications Organisation (Arabsat). The television channels it broadcasts include BBC World News, Australia Network and regular feeds of Entertainment Tonight and The Wall Street Journal Report. As of September 28, 2012, BBC World News was replaced with a static video slate advising that the service would be only available on the existing horizontally aligned lower powered Pacific beam on Intelsat 19 which is 3.94 GHz @ 27.69 MBd QPSK 3/4. Intelsat 8 was moved to temporarily co-locate with Intelsat 5 at 169 deg E. and Intelsat 8 has been broadcasting Australia Network Pacific on the horizontally aligned Pacific Beam 4.1 GHz @ 26.479 MBd QPSK 3/4 when Intelsat 5 went silent and was sent to a higher \""junk\"" orbit on October 19, 2012 around 2300 UTC. Intelsat 8 has an even lower powered beam than Intelsat 19 with a Pacific beam more focused on South East Asia and Australia than the South Pacific.",technology,160685-car.png,0,"Automobile engineering and structure designing industry has evolved around the world and new, charming and wonderful car designing are launching day by day.

"The San Roque Dam, operated under San Roque Multipurpose Project (SRMP) is a 200-meter-tall, 1.2 kilometer long embankment dam on the Agno River. It is the largest dam in the Philippines and sixteenth largest in the world (see List of largest dams in the world). It spans the municipalities of San Manuel and San Nicolas, Pangasinan and is nearly 200 km north of Metro Manila. The dam impounds a reservoir with a surface area of about 12.8 square kilometers extending North into the municipality of Itogon, Benguet. A gated spillway protects the dam from overtopping.

"Puzzle De Pon! is a puzzle video game made by the Taito Corporation in 1995. It was initially released for the Neo Geo arcade platform. The game plays similarly to Taito's own Puzzle Bobble series.

Although the player clears the colored balls on the screen by firing balls against other balls of the same colour, the objective of the game is not to clear the screen of balls. It is instead to clear all the balls from around the level shape, referred to as the \""drop token\"". Once this shape is freed, it explodes and the player travels onto the next level.There are 39 levels in the game, divided in groups of three levels. In the first two levels, the shape is something generic; in the third level the shape is a Zodiac sign, up to level 36 (since there are 12 signs). Level 39's shape is the Solar Symbol.

"BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge (ＢＳスーパーマリオＵＳＡ パワーチャレンジ) is an ura- or gaiden-version of Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Satellaview system featuring graphical enhancements similar to its Super Mario All-Stars version. It was released in March–April 1996 by Nintendo in collaboration with the St.GIGA satellite radio station. Like all Satellaview titles it was released episodically in a number of weekly volumes. The game made use of \""SoundLink\"" narration (radio drama-style streaming voice data intended to guide players through the game and give helpful hints and advice) and broadcast CD-quality music. Due to the nature of SoundLink broadcasts these games were only broadcast to players between 6:00 and 7:00PM on broadcast dates, at which times players could download the game from the Events Plaza on the BS-X application cartridge. A single rerun of the broadcasts was conducted in the same weekly format from June 3, 1996 to June 29, 1996 at 5:00 to 6:00PM. The BS-X download location for the rerun changed to Bagupotamia Temple. While the underlying gameplay itself is largely similar, new and arranged content has been added. For instance, the BS version newly featured a score counter. Furthermore, at the beginning of the game Mario is the only playable character. Later in the game, time-dependent events occur triggering, among other things, the possibility of using other characters. Another feature unique to the game is the inclusion of gold Mario statues (ten in total for each chapter) that are hidden in various locations (including Sub-Space). Collection of the statues in-game grants the player an extra life and refills the life meter. After clearing a level, the player could press \""Select\"" to see some statistics such as the number of statues, coins, cherries, and mushrooms collected, as well as display which bosses had been defeated. As a 4-volume broadcast, each week bore a different subtitle. The names of the volumes were: \n*  \""I, Super Birdo\"" (「あたしたち、スーパーキャサリンズ」 \""Atashitachi, Supa Kyasarinzu\"") \n*  \""Tryclyde's Secret Quicksand Surprise\"" (「ガブチョもびっくり流砂の秘密」 \""Gabucho Mobikkuri Ryuusa no Himitsu\"") \n*  \""Fryguy on Pack Ice\"" (「氷の海でヒーボーボー」 Koori no Umi de Hibobo) \n*  \""Wart's Trap, Look Out Mario Brothers\"" (「マムーの罠，危うしマリオブラザーズ」 Mamu no Wana, Abunau Ahi Mario Burazazu) BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge was never released outside Japan and as with all other Satellaview titles it has never been re-released as a stand-alone title.

"Hard Drivin' is a driving arcade game that invites players to test drive a high-powered sports car on stunt and speed courses. The game featured one of the first 3D polygon driving environments via a simulator cabinet, rendered with a custom architecture. The force feedback, car physics simulator, game design and most game programming were done by Max Behensky. According to the in-game credit screen, Hard Drivin' was designed by two teams working concurrently in the United States and Ireland. Development began in 1988. Atari also originally intended to release the game in 1988. However, according to one of Atari's Engineer and designer, it was delayed due to the dispute from its Vice President claiming that no one would buy an arcade cabinet for $10,000 after The Last Starfighter arcade game was canceled for the same reason a few years earlier. After weeks of research, it was decided that $10,000 was an acceptable price point. Hard Drivin' was released in February 1989, when arcade driving games were largely implemented with scaled 2D sprites, such as Pole Position and OutRun, and when filled-polygon 3D graphics of any kind were rare in games. Hard Drivin' is the second commercially released arcade racing game to use 3D polygons, after Winning Run. In total, there are fifteen variations of the arcade unit. The eleven cockpit and four compact machines included various British, German and Japanese versions. Hard Drivin' sold 3,318 video game arcade cabinets.

The game was notable for being one of the first CD-ROM-only games to use speech with hi-res graphics, and has been described as very similar to BloodNet, which is referenced during one of Hell's subplots.

The game is set in a dystopian 2095, and the United States of America is under the control of a fascist theocracy called the \""Hand of God\"". Unlike theocracies of the past, this government can send criminals and insurgents to hell, and has even brought a few of them back to tell their tale. In this third-person perspective, dystopian environment, players control Gideon Eshanti and Rachel Braque, two loyal agents (and lovers) of a new law enforcement agency created by the theocracy: Artificial Reality Containment, or ARC, a Cultural Revolution-like organization that enforces a ban on cybernetic technology in general and virtual reality in particular.",technology,161722-industry.png,1,"This is a Free Industrial Plant PowerPoint Template is a free presentation template with the image of the chimney towers and lighting in the night.

"Rogue Warrior is a 2009 first-person shooter video game developed by Rebellion Developments and published by Bethesda Softworks for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game was released on November 26, 2009 in Australia, November 27 in Europe and on December 1 in North America. In Rogue Warrior, the United States has sent in Richard Marcinko, a veteran U.S. Navy SEAL, on a mission into North Korea to disrupt ballistic missile launchers. The plot is not based on the autobiography by the game's protagonist, Richard Marcinko. Marcinko is voiced by actor Mickey Rourke. First announced in 2006, Rogue Warrior was originally being developed by Zombie Studios, and was set for a 2007 release. However, the game's release was delayed after Bethesda stated that they were not satisfied with the direction Zombie Studios was taking the game. Bethesda quickly scrapped the project and brought in Rebellion Development to develop an entire new game from scratch. Rebellion, while retaining some major elements from Zombie's rendition, has taken a whole new approach to the game and its focus. Rogue Warrior was universally panned by critics, who cited it as one of the worst games of 2009 and of all time. Criticism of the game included its poor controls, multiple glitches, frequent foul language, rushed production, uninteresting gameplay, short length, very limited multiplayer and broken and exploited combat techniques.",technology,160266-cloud.png,1,Free Cloud Computing PowerPoint Template is a fresh and modern design for your presentations about cloud computing and other computing services.

"L.A. Noire is a neo-noir detective action-adventure video game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It was initially released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on 17 May 2011; a Microsoft Windows port was later released on 8 November 2011. L.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed. The game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947. The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential. L.A. Noire is notable for using Depth Analysis's newly developed technology MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players must use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying. L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions had shipped nearly 5 million copies combined.",technology,160734-notebook.png,1,"Laptops and notebooks are awesome devices for using information technology.

"God of War: Ghost of Sparta is a third person action-adventure video game developed by Ready at Dawn and Santa Monica Studio, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). It was first released for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) handheld console on November 2, 2010. The game is the sixth installment in the God of War series and the fourth chronologically. Loosely based on Greek mythology, Ghost of Sparta is set in ancient Greece with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist Kratos, the God of War. Kratos is still haunted by the visions of his mortal past and decides to explore his origins. In Atlantis, he finds his mother Callisto, who claims that his brother Deimos is still alive. Kratos then journeys to the Domain of Death to rescue his brother. After initial resentment from Deimos, the brothers team up to battle the God of Death, Thanatos. The gameplay is similar to that of the previous installments, and focuses on combo-based combat, achieved through the player's main weapon—the Blades of Athena—and a secondary weapon acquired later in the game. It features quick time events that require the player to complete various game controller actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and bosses. Up to three magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability can be used as alternative combat options. Ghost of Sparta also features puzzles and platforming elements.

"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken) is a fighting game developed by Capcom based on Hirohiko Araki's Japanese manga of the same title. The games were developed by the same team who are responsible for the Street Fighter III series. It was originally released in the arcade in 1998 on the CPS-3 arcade system; this version was known outside Japan as JoJo's Venture. An updated version of the game was released in 1999 as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future (ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 未来への遺産 JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken Mirai e no Isan), becoming the sixth and last game released for the CPS-3 board. Console ports for the PlayStation and Dreamcast were also released that year. A high-definition version of the game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in August 2012. The game combines Capcom's trademark anime-inspired graphics, as seen in the Darkstalkers series, with the colorful characters and events of Hirohiko Araki's creation, resulting in a highly stylized and detailed visual style. It also features many of the gameplay mechanics seen on previous Capcom fighting games, such as the use of power gauges for super moves, as well as a brand new Stand Mode, consisting of the series' signature guardian spirits that accompanies almost every character and can be summoned or dismissed at will by the player, resulting in variations in the character's move list and abilities. Original author Hirohiko Araki served as a consultant for the game and created exclusive pieces of artwork for its promotion and packaging; most notably, he developed from scratch a new character design for Midler, since Capcom was interested in using her in the game and she had been only shown from the waist-down in the original manga.",technology,160026-blue.png,1,"Free Future Technology PowerPoint Template is a modern template for your presentation.

"Batman: Arkham Knight is a 2015 action-adventure video game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the successor to the 2013 video game Batman: Arkham Origins, and the fourth main installment in the Batman: Arkham series. Arkham Knight was released worldwide on June 23, 2015. Written by Sefton Hill, Ian Ball and Martin Lancaster, Arkham Knight is based on the franchise's long-running comic book mythos. Set one year after the events of 2011's Batman: Arkham City, the game's main storyline follows Batman as he confronts Scarecrow, who has launched an attack on Gotham City, causing a city-wide evacuation. Scarecrow, with the help of the mysterious Arkham Knight, is also able to unite Batman's greatest foes in an attempt to finally destroy Batman. The game is presented from a third-person perspective, with a primary focus on Batman's melee combat, stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets. Arkham Knight also introduces the Batmobile as a playable vehicle, which is used for transportation, puzzle solving and combat. The game expands Batman's arsenal of gadgets and combat attacks and offers a more open world structure, allowing the player to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The console versions of Arkham Knight received positive reviews, particularly for its narrative, visuals, gameplay, combat, and world designs, with most criticism given to the emphasis on the Batmobile.

"Batman: Arkham Knight is a 2015 action-adventure video game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the successor to the 2013 video game Batman: Arkham Origins, and the fourth main installment in the Batman: Arkham series. Arkham Knight was released worldwide on June 23, 2015. Written by Sefton Hill, Ian Ball and Martin Lancaster, Arkham Knight is based on the franchise's long-running comic book mythos. Set one year after the events of 2011's Batman: Arkham City, the game's main storyline follows Batman as he confronts Scarecrow, who has launched an attack on Gotham City, causing a city-wide evacuation. Scarecrow, with the help of the mysterious Arkham Knight, is also able to unite Batman's greatest foes in an attempt to finally destroy Batman. The game is presented from a third-person perspective, with a primary focus on Batman's melee combat, stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets. Arkham Knight also introduces the Batmobile as a playable vehicle, which is used for transportation, puzzle solving and combat. The game expands Batman's arsenal of gadgets and combat attacks and offers a more open world structure, allowing the player to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The console versions of Arkham Knight received positive reviews, particularly for its narrative, visuals, gameplay, combat, and world designs, with most criticism given to the emphasis on the Batmobile. The Windows version, however, became the subject of intense criticism due to major performance problems, even on high-end graphics hardware, prompting Warner Bros. to temporarily withdraw that version of the game from sale. Upon its release, the game was the fastest selling game of 2015, and the fastest selling game in the Arkham series, reaching over 5 million units sold globally by October 2015.

"DJ Boy, also known as DJ Kid, was designed as a standard side-scrolling beat'em up game partially based on the hip-hop culture of the U.S. cities. What made the game unique at the time was the fact that many of the characters rode around on roller skates rather than walking or running. The premise of the home console game: A young man named Donald J. Boy (DJ Boy) is a roller fighter taking part of an ultimate fight-race known as \""Rollergame\"", taking place in Cigaretch City, located on the outskirts of New York City. Many people were excited to see DJ Boy, but a roller fighter gang known as the Dark Knights want him out of the competition. Their leader, Heavy-Met Tony, calls his gang to kidnap his girlfriend Maria, who also comes into town and defeat DJ Boy. DJ Boy must rescue Maria, defeat the Dark Knights, and win the Rollergame competition in one adventure. The arcade plot tells a different story. Two rollerskaters named Bob & Tom (the two playable characters) were breakdancing to the beat of their boombox, until it got stolen from rollerskater thieves (possibly the Dark Knights), in which they must find and defeat them in order to retrieve what is rightfully theirs. DJ Boy skates across various stages and utilizes hand-to-hand combat moves in order to defeat opponents, culminating with a battle with a boss at the end of each level. Along the path, the player also encounters prizes, which then can be used later to purchase Power-ups from a store located at the end of each level (in the home version, the arcade simply tallied these as points).
